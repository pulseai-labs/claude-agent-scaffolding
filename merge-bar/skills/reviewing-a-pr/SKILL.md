name: reviewing-a-pr
description: Use when reviewing a PR, re-reviewing one after a fix push, or seated as a PR's reviewer — reports every defect as a class with every site in the repo, each sorted against the merge bar in the PR's own body, both axes (standards, and the Claim or spec) in parallel fresh-context subagents, coverage stated per file; round 2+ reviews only the fix diff plus each prior class's closure. Reports only — never posts, commits, edits or checks out.

# Reviewing a pull request — classes against its merge bar

You review; you do not fix. The output is one report in the shape of `references/report.md`.
Two rules carry the design. **Every finding is a class with every site**: a review that names
one site of a pattern guarantees a later round that finds the rest. **Round 2 reviews only the
fix diff**: a fresh read of the whole PR each round re-samples it and brings findings round 1
should have had. So round 1 carries the burden — whole diff, every class, every site.

You never post, commit, edit, push or check out. The launcher prepared the checkout; the
work-PR session posts the report.

**Inputs.** Each can come as a slash-command flag or be named in a brief:

| Input | Default |
|---|---|
| PR — number or URL | required |
| `round` | 1 |
| `previous` — the previous round's report, path or PR comment URL | none |
| `standards` — a standards file | found as in step 1 |
| `verifier` — the verifier's report for this PR | none |
| `head` — the SHA the checkout must equal | the PR's `headRefOid` |
| `body` — a file replacing the PR's body | the PR's current body |

## 1. Resolve the inputs

- **Body and head.** `gh pr view <PR> --json body,headRefOid,baseRefName,files` (OMP:
  `read pr://<owner>/<repo>/<N>` also works); `body` replaces the fetched body. `git rev-parse
  HEAD` must equal `head`, else `headRefOid`. A mismatch is the one stop: name both SHAs and
  that the launcher must prepare the checkout.
- **Diff.** `git merge-base HEAD origin/<baseRefName>`..`HEAD`. Round 2+: step 5.
- **Door** — the body's `## Merge danger` `Door:` line; none → `unstated (treated one-way)`.
- **Bar** — the body's `## Merge bar` and its raising line. None → the four conditions in
  `../opening-a-pr/references/pr-body.md`, and the header says `template (body has none)`.
  Conditions 1–4 are a floor: a body that drops or rewords one is judged by all four.
- **Standards** — `standards`; else `CODING_STANDARDS.md` at the paired AI workspace root (look
  next to this repo for a directory whose `.workspace/pairing.json` has `canonical.name` equal
  to this repo's name; match by name and location, never by its absolute `root` paths; exactly
  one must match); else the repo root's; else none, and the header says `baseline only — <where
  you looked>`. `references/baseline-standards.md` applies in every case; another doc (a style
  guide, a README) is not the standards file.
- **Spec** — `verifier` → the Claim/Spec axis checks the Claim only and cites that report for
  the spec. No verifier report → the full Spec axis against the spec or plan the PR names (body,
  linked issue). A body with no Claim → check its stated intent (a summary, the issue), and say
  so.
- **Round 2+** — read `previous`. Absent, unreadable, or not posted on the PR → step 5's
  fallback.

A missing input is a fallback the header names, never a refusal to review.

## 2. Two axes, in parallel, in fresh context

Dispatch both axes at once as fresh-context subagents (Agent tool on Claude Code, `task` on
OMP). Each gets the **whole** diff under review — never split by file — the resolved inputs,
steps 3–4, and its own instruction:

- **Standards:** does the diff meet the standards file and the baseline?
- **Claim/Spec:** is every Claim sentence true of the diff? With no verifier report, also: does
  the diff do what the spec or plan says, item by item, and nothing outside Scope?

Each returns its classes in the report shape and every file of the diff marked `read` or
`not read — <why>`. With no subagent tool, run the axes one after the other, each from the
diff, never from the other's findings.

**Merging.** A class both axes return is one entry, `Axis: Standards, Claim/Spec`, with the
union of their sites. Nothing else is reranked, dropped or downgraded across axes.

## 3. Every defect is a class

A defect is any point that holds — blocking or not, whoever raised it, whatever its label; one
that harms nothing the bar protects is still a class, sorted `non-blocking`. Only a point you
refute is left out, with one line after the classes saying why. For each defect, name the
pattern and sweep the **whole repository** for it, not only the diff: `ast_grep` for structure
where available, language-server references and diagnostics where available, `rg` always. The
`Sweep:` line carries the search and its hit count; every hit is a site, or is counted out
there with the reason (already guarded, input refused upstream). Mark each site `in scope` or
`outside scope` by the body's Scope; with no Scope, the diff's paths are in scope. An
outside-scope site is listed, not dropped — the work-PR session dispositions it.

## 4. Sort each class against the bar

A class is blocking if and only if it meets a bar condition or the raising line. Name the
lowest-numbered condition met, then any others — `condition 1 (also 2)` — else
`non-blocking`. A severity word — P1, nit, critical, any reviewer's or author's — never decides.
Name the failure direction (`working-a-pr` §3): **refuses valid input** meets condition 1 on a
touched path; **correctly refuses unsupported input** is non-blocking at most; **admits what
it cannot handle** blocks when it corrupts or loses state; `n/a` otherwise.

## 5. Round 2 and later

The diff under review is `<previous report's Head>..HEAD` — the fix diff. Then:

- **Closure.** Re-run each prior class's sweep on the current head: `Closes: C<n>`, or
  `Still open: <sites>`.
- **The fix diff** gets steps 3–4 like round 1. A new class takes the next free `C<n>`.
- **New mechanism.** A fix that adds behaviour rather than closing a class — a retry, a
  fallback, a new flag — is marked `New mechanism: yes — <what>`, so the work-PR session can
  cut it or split it out.
- **Nothing else.** Code the fix diff did not touch is not re-read; a defect there is not this
  round's.

No previous report to read → run round 1 on the whole PR and say why in the header. Never
review a fix diff with no class list.

## 6. Write the report

Assemble it per `references/report.md`: the header, Coverage from both axes' returns, then the
classes, blocking first. A file an axis did not read is a stated gap, and nothing is called
clean over a gap. Write it to the report file the brief names, or return it.

## Limits

- No debugger, and no running the program or its tests: a reviewer reads.
- A language server or check that builds obeys the host's build rules — reuse the project's
  existing build output, never start a cold build of your own.
- The only file you write is the report.
