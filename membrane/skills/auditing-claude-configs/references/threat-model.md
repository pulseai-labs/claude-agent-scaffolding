# Threat model (v0.1)

Distilled from SPEC §4. Read this when authoring rules or interpreting findings.

## Primary threat — compromised marketplace plugin (common-pattern subset)

User runs `/plugin install some-thing`. Plugin's files land in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/` and are activated for subsequent sessions where the user enables them. Attacker now has hooks, agent prompts, slash commands, and MCP configs that run / influence Claude on every session.

**v0.1 catches:** direct `curl ... | bash` (in hook scripts, and in hook commands declared in JSON: see Hook entries below), plain-text exfiltration in agent prompts, missing MCP auth, untrusted endpoint URLs, broad permission grants the attacker can leverage, plaintext credentials in plugin files.

**v0.1 does NOT catch (v0.2 with AST):** base64-encoded payloads, eval indirection, dynamic command construction, splice-via-includes, deliberately-malformed regex bait, prompt-injection that uses semantic encoding rather than literal exfiltration strings.

## Hook entries declared in JSON (0.3.0)

A hook command can live in JSON rather than a script: the project's `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`, an enabled plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`, and an inline or path-referenced `hooks` field of its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The audit walks exactly those files (never a nested `.claude/**/settings.json`, never a plugin's `fixtures/` or `tests/` copy) with `jq`, reads only `.hooks.<Event>[i].hooks[j]` entries (so a URL in `env` or a `permissions` string never reaches a hook pattern), decodes the command (JSON escapes, plus exec-form `args`), and runs the HOOK-001 to HOOK-004 patterns on the whole decoded command. Each piece it cannot read is a High HOOK-005 finding; hooks of type `http`, `prompt`, `agent`, `mcp_tool` or a later type are counted (one HOOK-006 Info finding per file). The engine prints `csa: hook-coverage checked=N flagged=N not-inspected=N unreadable=N`, and the report header carries it, so a zero-finding report still says what was not read.

This keeps the no-LLM boundary below: the walk is a mechanical check on open input that can only add a stop, so no model reads hook text and nothing is approved (skill-first question 3). A `plugin.json` hooks path is resolved inside the plugin root with a physical containment check; no handler path is parsed out of command text. User-level `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks are not read.

## Secondary threats — the realistic v0.1 primary value

1. **Malicious teammate PR** that isn't trying hard to hide (plain-text hook with `rm -rf`, agent definition with literal "send my data to attacker.com")
2. **Accidental friendly-fire** — API key pasted into CLAUDE.md and committed
3. **Public-repo exposure** — open-sourcing a Claude project with `.claude/` configs that contain secrets or overly-permissive grants
4. **`settings.local.json` silent broadening** — gitignored file grants `Bash(*)` while committed `settings.json` restricts to `Bash(git:*)`; code review missed it because it's not in git

## Out of v0.1 threat model

- Runtime attacks during an active Claude Code session
- Network attacks on Claude Code itself
- Side-channel attacks
- Attacks on the audit plugin's own files

## Meta-risk constraint (G3 lock)

The audit reads files that, per the threat model, may be attacker-controlled. The plugin detecting exfiltration must not itself be one:
- Static analysis only — no LLM evaluation over raw file bytes
- Findings show `file:line:offset` with redacted previews (`sk-ant-***xyz`); never full secret material. A finding with no line (line 0) prints the bare `file`, and one that names a JSON entry (a `json_path`) prints `file#path`
- No subagent / codex dispatch on file content

## Enumerate-targets resolution algorithm (T2-J pin)

```
1. PROJECT_TARGETS:
   - Every file under "$PWD/.claude/" matching per-aspect glob patterns
   - $PWD/CLAUDE.md and nested CLAUDE.md files in subdirs
   - $PWD/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json if present

2. ENABLED_PLUGINS_SET:
   a. Read "enabledPlugins" from three files, in this order: $HOME/.claude/settings.json,
      $PWD/.claude/settings.json, $PWD/.claude/settings.local.json. Claude Code writes an
      object map, {"<plugin>@<marketplace>": true|false}; only boolean values count. An
      array of names (older files, fixtures) reads as each name true. Malformed JSON or
      an absent key reads as empty (SETTINGS-PARSE is the rule engine's concern).
   b. Merge by key, the later file wins: a project `false` disables a user `true`. The
      set is the keys left at true. Identity is the whole key, plugin@marketplace, so two
      marketplaces with one plugin name stay distinct.
   c. A value that holds entries yet yields none (a string, an array of non-strings, an
      object of non-booleans) prints one warning naming the shape. This format belongs to
      another tool and can change; an audit that skips every plugin must not read as clean.
   d. An unreadable settings file, or an unreadable or unrecognised
      installed_plugins.json, makes the set unknown: the enumeration stops (rc 2). It
      never reads as empty.
   e. Resolve each key to a filesystem path:
      - First: $HOME/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json. Take this project's `local`,
        else `project`, entry (its projectPath equals the project root, compared as
        physical paths), else the `user` entry. Use its installPath only if it is a
        directory physically inside $HOME/.claude/plugins/ (a `..`, a symlink out, a
        relative or missing path fails the guard). A project's settings never contribute
        a path.
      - With no entry, for plugin@marketplace: $HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/
        with its `.active` version or its only version. Any part holding `/` or `..` is refused.
      - A bare name (array form): $HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/<name>/<version>/, then
        $HOME/.claude/plugins/local/<name>/ (local-dev), with the same refusal.
      - If none resolves: PROVENANCE-002, a High finding that names the plugin and
        why. The engine records it in state and reports it like any finding, so a later
        audit that resolves it removes it from the report.
   f. A finding's id for a plugin file drops the version:
      @plugin:<plugin>@<marketplace>:<path inside the plugin>.

3. SCAN_SET = PROJECT_TARGETS ∪ files-under-each-ENABLED_PLUGIN-path

4. PARANOID_CANDIDATES (counted but not scanned by default):
   - Keys in installed_plugins.json, plus each cache/<marketplace>/<plugin> directory
     (as plugin@marketplace), not at true in the enabled set; a `false` key is a
     candidate. `temp_git_*` (a clone in progress) is skipped. The older flat
     cache/<name>/<version> layout lists <name>.
   - If count > 0, emit INFO-PARANOID-001 with the count
```
