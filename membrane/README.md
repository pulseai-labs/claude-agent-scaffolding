# membrane

Static-analysis security audit for Claude Code and Codex project configurations and enabled plugins.

> **Inspired by AgentShield in [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)** (Mustafa, 2026; MIT). This implementation is an independent, focused MIT-licensed audit tool tailored to composable plugin marketplaces.

## What it catches (v0.1)

- **Plaintext secrets** in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, and `.codex/` files (API keys, JWTs, GitHub PATs, AWS keys, env-var-shaped leaks)
- **Permission misconfigurations** including the high-impact **schema-validation** check that catches typo'd field names like `"allowed"` instead of `"allow"` (which Claude Code silently ignores → user has no enforcement)
- **Hook injection** patterns (curl|bash, rm -rf, unbounded eval, plaintext network exfiltration) in hook scripts **and in hook commands declared in JSON**: the project's `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`, and an enabled plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. A hook entry that cannot be read is a High finding (HOOK-005); hooks of another type are counted (HOOK-006); every report states how many hook entries were checked, flagged, not inspected and unreadable
- **MCP server misconfiguration** (untrusted endpoints, missing auth, env-var leaks)
- **Prompt injection** in agent definitions and slash commands (common patterns)
- **Marketplace integrity** (non-HTTPS URLs, malformed marketplace.json, Claude `.claude-plugin/` manifests, Codex `.agents/plugins/` and `.codex-plugin/` manifests)
- **`settings.local.json` silent broadening** (gitignored file overrides committed settings)

## What it does NOT catch (v0.1)

v0.1 uses bash + jq + regex (no AST). A determined adversary who obfuscates payloads (base64, eval indirection, dynamic command construction) will evade most v0.1 rules. AST-based detection is on the v0.2 roadmap.

**Treat a clean audit as:** "doesn't trip our v0.1 common-pattern rules."
**NOT as:** "this plugin/config is safe to trust."

**Hook limits.** The hook patterns are the same common-pattern regexes everywhere, so obfuscation (base64, `eval` of a variable, a split string) still gets through; the "clean audit" caveat above covers hook commands too. Also not read:
- a handler script outside `.claude/hooks/` and outside the plugin directory (the command that calls it is checked);
- `http`, `prompt`, `agent` and `mcp_tool` hooks (counted, not inspected);
- user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks (the audit is project-scoped);
- hooks declared in skill or agent frontmatter, inline hooks in a marketplace entry, managed-policy hooks, and Codex or OpenCode hook formats;
- a plugin installed outside the `cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/` layout (a `local/` plugin, or an install record that points elsewhere): its `hooks/hooks.json` and `plugin.json` are not read as hook entries;
- a `plugin.json` hooks path that is a symlink, escapes the plugin root or is missing: reported as HOOK-005, not followed;
- `rm -rf "$HOME"/x`: HOOK-002 matches only `rm -rf` of an absolute path, in files and in hook entries alike.

Realistic v0.1 value:
1. Catching accidental friendly-fire (secrets committed to CLAUDE.md)
2. Naive-malicious teammate PRs
3. Pre-publish hygiene before open-sourcing a Claude project
4. The common-pattern subset of compromised-plugin attacks

## Install

Via Claude Code marketplace:

```
/plugin install membrane
```

Via Codex marketplace:

```
codex plugin marketplace add github:pulseai-labs/pulsestack
```

## Usage

```
/security-audit                           # full audit
/security-audit --focus secrets           # one aspect
/security-audit --verbose                 # show Info findings
/security-audit --show-suppressed         # also show suppressed
/security-audit --suppress SA-2026-...    # dismiss a finding (refuses Critical)
/secrets-scan                             # alias for --focus secrets
/permissions-review                       # alias for --focus permissions
/apply-fix SA-2026-...                    # apply one safe-category fix
/apply-fix FUID-a3f9b21c                  # same, using durable ID
```

## Opt-in SessionStart reminder

The plugin ships `hooks/session-start-reminder.sh` but does NOT register it. To enable a "last audit N days ago" reminder on session start, add this to your **own** `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "command": "bash $HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/membrane/<version>/hooks/session-start-reminder.sh" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Why opt-in: the plugin's threat model flags plugin-installed SessionStart hooks as a Critical attack surface. Forcing the hook on every user would put the plugin's own shell into the very surface its rules treat as high-severity. Your install, your choice.

## What gets written to disk

The plugin writes audit state to `<project>/.claude/audits/` for compatibility
with the existing report/state format, even when scanning Codex surfaces:
- `state.json` — durable finding registry + audit history + tamper-detection mtimes
- `<date>-<NN>.md` — per-run report with stable finding IDs
- `suppressions.json` — your dismissed findings (gitignored per-developer)
- `.lock` — transient lock file during audit runs

The **first audit run** adds `.claude/audits/` to your `.gitignore` automatically (idempotent; handles nested git repos and missing `.gitignore`).

## Findings reference

| Severity | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Immediate action | hook running `curl ... \| bash`; plaintext production API key |
| High | Fix this session | MCP with no auth; settings.local.json broadens; schema typo silently disables |
| Medium | Fix within sessions | `Bash(*)` instead of `Bash(git:*)`; agent prompt with vague injection signals |
| Low | Hygiene | localhost dev URLs; permissions slightly too broad |
| Info | Observation | "N plugins in cache not enabled here"; "no audit baseline yet" |

Scanner failures are findings too, not a clean read: SCANNER-001 (a rule failed to load, High), SCANNER-002 (a rule's check failed on a target, for example a `settings.json` or `mcp.json` that is not JSON, High) and SCANNER-003 (the scan could not read a target, Medium; one per target). A malformed `settings.json` gives four SCANNER-002, one per permissions rule that reads it, or five when a `settings.local.json` sits beside it; that alone trips the "⚠ 4 rule(s) failed during scan" banner.

Critical findings **cannot be suppressed**; they must be remediated.

**What chat lists.** Findings in an enabled plugin's `fixtures/` or `tests/` directory and in the project's `.dagr/scratch/` are scanned like any other, but chat shows them as one line, `N findings in plugin fixtures/tests and agent scratch copies (C critical, H high, M medium); listed in the report`, and not one by one. The totals and the severity table count them, and the report lists each at full severity under a `Group:` line. `--verbose` lists them in chat. A project's own `tests/` is not in the group.

**SECRETS-004 skips two shapes.** A run of 40 or more base64 characters is not reported when it is pure hex (a git SHA, a sha256 digest) on a line that names no credential, or a slash-heavy path (two or more `/`, every segment a lower-case, digit, Capitalized or UPPER-CASE word). A hex credential on a line with no credential word (`dop_v1_<64 hex>`) is therefore no longer reported by SECRETS-004; one beside `token`, `secret`, `passw`, `api_key`, `auth`, `credential` or `private_key` still is, and SECRETS-003 reports `NAME=value`. A documentation URL with `XXXX` segments, or a base32 or hex token as a path segment, is skipped too.

**Upgrading to 0.5.0.** A finding's durable id (`FUID-...`) from the free-text rules (HOOK-001 to HOOK-003 in script files, PROMPT-INJ-001, PROMPT-INJ-002, SECRETS-001 to SECRETS-004, CLAUDE-MD-001, CLAUDE-MD-002, MCP-001 to MCP-003, MARKETPLACE-001, PERM-001, PERM-003, PERM-005, PROVENANCE-002) changes once when its excerpt is over 200 characters or holds a secret-shaped or 32-character run, so that a long match can no longer share the id of a different one. A suppression or baseline entry for such a finding reads NEW once and must be suppressed again. Short findings keep their ids. See the CHANGELOG.

**Upgrading to 0.5.1.** A HOOK-004 finding in a script file (`network-exfiltration`) gets a new durable id once, because the id now follows what the rule matched (the network commands and sensitive paths that fire, and the lines that hold both) and not the first 200 characters of the file. It reads NEW in the next audit and must be suppressed again; the old entry in `.claude/audits/suppressions.json` matches nothing and can be removed by hand. HOOK-004 read from `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, or an enabled plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` keeps its id; any other file under `.claude/hooks/`, JSON included, is a script file and moves. See the CHANGELOG.

**Upgrading to 0.5.2.** HOOK-004 (`network-exfiltration`) fires on fewer files: `async`, `sync`, `curly`, `.curlrc`, `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` and the like no longer count as a network command or as a name. A finding in a script file whose names or both-lines came from such a token (a script with `rsync `, a JS or TS hook with `async `, a Go `func `, `openssh `, or a `.ssh ` as in `chmod 700 ~/.ssh `) usually gets a new durable id once, and so does a file with `nc` then an em space when audited under a UTF-8 locale; it reads NEW in the next audit and must be suppressed again, and the old entry in `.claude/audits/suppressions.json` matches nothing and can be removed by hand. A finding that stops firing leaves its old suppression the same way. An id whose names and lines are unchanged keeps it, including a file that still has a real `nc `, `ssh ` or `curl`. See the CHANGELOG.
