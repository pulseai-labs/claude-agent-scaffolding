# The names are the source: each alternative is built from its name, and the excerpt's names are read from the same
# arrays, so a name cannot be dropped or shifted apart from the alternative it names (#1098). The names are their own
# arrays (not derived from the regex text) so the uid keeps the 0.5.1 names, and a file that fires on the same names
# and lines keeps its uid (#1113).
# Network names: a leading boundary (start, a byte that is not a letter, digit, "_", "." or "-", or a backslash and
# n, r or t, the escaped newline, CR or tab of a JSON, JS or $'...' string) keeps "async",
# "sync", "func", "openssh " and ".curlrc" from naming nc, ssh, curl or wget, and keeps "~/.ssh " from naming ssh.
# curl, wget and rsync end at a non-letter or the end ("curly", "curling" and "rsyncd" do not name them; "curl.exe",
# "wget2" and "curl_chrome116" do). nc, ssh and scp end at whitespace, so "ssh-keygen" and "ssh-add" do not name ssh.
# Sensitive names have their dots escaped: the "." in "~/.ssh" is a dot, not any byte or a newline.
# Lost on purpose, named in the CHANGELOG: a name after a letter, digit, "_", "." or "-" ("run_curl", "x-curl", "sh.curl(",
# "${CURL:-curl}", "curlie" and "pycurl" at their ends).
# ERE only: no \b, \< or [[:<:]], which are not portable. Not run on bash 3.2 or BSD grep (CI is ubuntu).

# _csa_hook004_excerpt <content> — what the uid hashes (#1098): the names of the alternatives that fire
# ("net=..;path=.."), then, when some line holds both a network and a sensitive match, ";lines=" and the sha256 of
# those lines. The line bytes are kept exact: a trailing CR is dropped, leading and trailing spaces and tabs are
# trimmed, and the set is byte-sorted without duplicates. Nothing is squeezed inside a line, so two lines that
# differ inside their trimmed ends never share a digest, and the digest holds no whitespace, so the squeeze in
# csa_finding_uid_raw cannot equate two line sets. One test per alternative and no loop over matches (that is
# quadratic on a file of many matches).
# The whole function runs under a local LC_ALL=C, as _csa_hook004_match does for detection, so the names and the line part
# are both byte-wise and give the same uid in every locale. Bash 3.2's restore of a local LC_ALL is unverified (measured
# on bash 5.3 only).
# Skill-first: the names part is question 2, membrane's own fixed alternatives. The line part reads open text, but
# it can only split a uid relative to the names part, so what it mishandles either reads NEW, an extra stop (a quote
# change, any whitespace change inside a line), or adds no line and leaves the uid on the names floor (a command
# split across lines, a path in a variable). The caller hashes this with
# csa_finding_uid_raw: the plain form would cap it at 200 characters. The lines go only to sha256, never to output.
