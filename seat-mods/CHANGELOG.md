# Changelog

All notable changes to the `seat-mods` plugin.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-10-26

Batch 5 (#724, #702): fewer false stops on honest work, and the hiding spellings that can be closed
without a new one. seat-mods is still a rail that only adds a stop; what it misses goes to the next
judge as before.

- **A guarded seat may write and remove below `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR`.** Six of the nine refusals in
  real baton runs were scratch files in `/tmp`. Every guarded role, reviewers included, may Edit,
  Write and `rm` descendants of `/tmp` and of an absolute `$TMPDIR`, read from the seat's own
  environment on both hosts; a symlinked `/tmp` counts by both spellings. The directory itself and
  its ancestors stay protected from `rm`, and `rm -rf /tmp/*` is allowed: the accepted cost is that
  a seat can remove another session's scratch files. A scratch directory that holds the seat's own
  worktree is not added for that seat (an allowed directory outranks the worktree), so it keeps its
  refusals there; its other scratch places still apply. Other seats' trees under a broad `$TMPDIR`
  become writable, as `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` would make them.
- **`rm` follows a literal `cd` and literal variables in the same call.** `cd /w/wt && rm -rf
  pf/__pycache__` and `WT=/w/wt; cd "$WT" && rm -rf pf/__pycache__` are placed instead of refused;
  `cd "$WT" && rm …` with no `WT=` earlier in the call is still unresolved. A `cd` before `;` or a
  newline may fail, so the rm after it is checked in every directory it may run in; a variable stays
  known only across literal assignments, a literal `cd` and a bare `rm`. A `cd` in a subshell, an
  `if`, after `||` or in a pipeline, `cd -`, `cd ..`, `pushd`, `popd`, a `cd` before a Bash 5.3
  funsub and every other directory change stay unresolved, as before.
  A `CDPATH`, a `cd` alias, a shell-snapshot function that changes directory (zoxide's `z`) and
  zsh's `cd` are not modelled.
- **Commands inside `$(…)` and backticks are read** (C1), unquoted, in double quotes, on a heredoc
  opener line and in an unquoted heredoc body, on every rail including the `rm` and `-F` readers.
  `git commit -m "$(git push --force)"` and ``git commit -m `git push --force` `` are denied.
  A command nested more than 8 substitutions deep is refused, reported as `no force-push`: an
  accepted false stop no honest command reaches.
- **Heredocs are read closer to the way Bash reads them** (C2). The tail of an opener line is read
  (`cat <<EOF; git push --force`), a delimiter is its word after quote removal (`<<\EOF`,
  `<<E'OF'`, `<<"E"OF`), several heredocs on a line close in order, a body line ending in a
  backslash joins the next only in an unquoted body, and a `<<` in `$((…))`, `((…))` or a comment
  opens none. Inside a `$(…)` a heredoc also closes, as in Bash 5.3, at a line that starts with its
  delimiter and holds a `)` after it, so `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)" && git push --force`
  is denied. `<<E'OF'` with a body line `E` was a false stop and is allowed.
- **The command word and glued redirections are read** (C3, C4): `\rm -rf …`, `\git push --force`,
  `{log}>f rm -rf …` and `git push --force>&2` (also `&>f`, `-f>/dev/null`) are denied.
- **On OMP, an `rm` operand with a leading `@` or `:` is placed both ways.** omp reads `@/tmp/x` as
  `/tmp/x`, but the shell removes `<cwd>/@/tmp/x`, in the worktree; both places must be allowed, so a
  reviewer is refused it.
- **Deny texts.** The rm and write denials name the scratch places beside the worktree and
  `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`, and the advice for an unreadable operand says what the guard reads now.
- **Shared reader.** `COMMANDS`, `HEREDOC`, `QUOTED`, `WRAPPERS`, `blankHeredocs`,
  `substitutionSpans`, `blank`, `commandOf`, `tokensOf`, `gitOf`, `substitutionsOf` and
  `SUBSTITUTION_TOO_DEEP` are copied byte for byte into molt 0.3.8's `hooks/shell.ts`, held by
  `tests/test-mod-shell-parity.sh`.
- **Still limits, now written down in the README.** A ruled command after a substitution on a
  heredoc opener line stays hidden, as in 0.9.0 (an `rm` there is still read); so do a `$'EOF'`
  delimiter, a `<<` inside an unquoted `$[…]` or a `${…}` (it opens a heredoc for the reader), a
  `#` after a blank in a quoted string inside `"$(…)"`, a command in a Bash 5.3 funsub, a quoted
  command word (`"rm" …`), a subscripted prefix (`A[0]=1 rm …`), a closing line `EOF)` in a `$(`
  opened before a newline outside quotes or before an earlier heredoc's body, a backslash-newline
  inside a word and the spans whose end the reader loses. C5 (a `&` inside a word) and C6
  (function bodies and syntax errors) still read wrongly toward a false stop. C8 (a partly quoted
  tilde, `rm ~""/scratch/x`) is a false stop too, but for a reviewer whose `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` holds
  `$HOME/scratch` it passes while Bash removes `<cwd>/~/scratch/x`.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-20

- **The orchestrator's waiting-on-operator line rings the bell** (#873, design
  2026-10-20-873-turn-end-judge-removal-design.md §5.2). When a status turn ends with a block
  whose `Waiting on operator:` field reads `decision:` or `action:` — whether the block passed or
  was let through after its one rewrite — and autonomic's session record says `mode: autopilot`,
  seat-mods rings that record's `bell` and shows `seat-mods: waiting on operator — <text>`. On
  Claude Code the line follows the reply (and any warning) at `turn.complete`; on OMP it is
  `ctx.ui.notify(notice, 'info')`. The text is redacted by a copy of autonomic's `redact` (pinned
  byte-identical), cut to one line and 200 characters. The signal only adds a notification: it
  never approves, answers or blocks, a failing or slow bell is logged and never holds the turn,
  and `none`, a manual session, no record, a molt handoff and a non-orchestrator role are quiet.
  `hooks/records.ts` copies molt's `autonomicPath`/`parseAutonomic`, and `hooks/register.ts` copies
  molt's `BELL_TIMEOUT_MS` and `ring`; `tests/test-mod-shell-parity.sh` pins all four pairs.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-19

- **The status-block check runs on OMP** (AI spec 2026-10-19-omp-status-block-port-design.md). A
  second OMP entry, `omp/status-extension.ts`, gives an OMP orchestrator the Claude Code status
  check: a status turn whose reply is not the five-field block gets one block, a block that waits on
  nothing while Next steps names work gets the idle block, and a second miss in the same turn goes
  through with an OMP warning notification. It reuses `hooks/status.ts` for every check and string.
  OMP's `input` cannot tell typing from a herdr send, so a turn is status by its crew tag, or when no
  input started it. It is a separate entry because OMP stops `session_stop` and `tool_call` at the
  first block in load order: `omp-seat` (omp-roles 0.8.0) keeps the guard first and loads this entry
  last, for the orchestrator only, so molt's and autonomic's stop blocks win as on Claude Code.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-19

- **The status block waits on the operator, and a blank line between fields is fine** (#879). The
  fifth field is `Waiting on operator:` (was `Operator decision pending:`), taking `none`,
  `decision: <question>` or `action: <what the operator must do>` — an action only the operator
  can take (start a fresh session, /clear, a login) now has a spelling, as a decision did. It is
  the block's second wait field beside `Waiting on (seats live):`, so the idle-stop contradiction
  (#876) reads both as before. A blank (whitespace-only) line between fields no longer fails the
  block as out of order: the five labels still come in order, one field per line, nothing before
  the first label and no non-blank line after the fifth, and the trailing-text failure names the
  new label. `checkBlock` and `isIdleStop` now read the fields through one shared reader. The
  context line teaches the new field, its forms and the blank-line allowance, and the idle copy's
  last sentence becomes "Do the next step now, or name the seat, wake, or operator decision or
  action you wait on."

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-18

- **A status block that says nothing waits no longer ends the turn** (#876). On a status turn of
  an orchestrator, a block `checkBlock` accepts is also read for the idle-stop contradiction:
  Waiting on (seats live) and Operator decision pending both read `none` (content starting with
  the word `none`, any case) while Next steps names work. The first stop is blocked once with
  `seat-mods (orchestrator): the status block says nothing waits, but Next steps names work. Do
  the next step now, or name the seat, wake or decision you wait on.`; the second lets the stop
  through and adds `⚠ seat-mods: status block says nothing waits, but Next steps names work.`
  under the reply. The one block per turn is shared with the shape check in either order: a turn
  nudged for idling gets no later shape rewrite, and a spent shape rewrite leaves the idle check
  warning only. The turn record now carries `warning` — the line of the failure that stood at the
  last stop — instead of `failedAfterRewrite`, and `STATUS_CONTEXT` gains one sentence teaching
  the rule. A finished run (all three fields `none`) ends the turn untouched; the molt exemption,
  the beneath-block rule and every role other than an orchestrator are unchanged.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-18

- **A status turn of an orchestrator ends with only the five-field status block** (#867). A status
  turn is one the operator did not start by typing; the block is `What I ruled:` / `What the PR(s)
  will carry:` / `Next steps:` / `Waiting on (seats live):` / `Operator decision pending:`, one
  field per line, each label bold or plain and followed on the same line by its content.
  - `prompt.submit` classifies the turn and, on a status turn, adds one line of model-only context
    (tool calls only, then the block). A prompt the operator types into a running status turn makes
    that turn free; a queued prompt (`ctrl+x enter`, `wait: true`) waits for a later turn and
    leaves the status turn alone.
  - `classic.Stop` checks `last_assistant_message` and blocks **once per turn** with a reason
    naming what failed; a second miss lets the stop through, and `turn.complete` then shows
    `⚠ seat-mods: status block missing — this status reply is not in the required form.` A block
    beneath seat-mods (autonomic's push) passes unchanged and is not seat-mods' rewrite; a
    subagent's `turn.complete` is ignored, and a turn ending on molt's `MOLT-HANDOFF:` is exempt.
  - Crew tags (`[crew report|molt|message <role>]`), the legacy ping forms (`REPORT READY: `,
    `MOLT WARNING `) and the two rotation resume forms count as status turns. The check calls no
    model; coordinator, guarded and unset roles are untouched.
  - **Known limit:** an operator prompt starting with `REPORT READY: ` is held to the block.
  - Claude Code only; the OMP extension is unchanged.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-10-18

- **Naming: the orchestrator's deny text and every launcher reference say `crew`** (crew 0.3.0's
  rename, spec §4.6). The rail's message now reads `seat-mods (orchestrator): no subagents —
  dispatch a crew seat instead (crew orchestrate; #798).`; the shared-rules comment and the
  README's rollout lines follow. No guard, profile or write-placement behaviour changes.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-10-17

- **Scratch work costs one turn, not several** (#844). A friction review of 88 OMP sessions found 12 write denials
  and 8 rm denials on scratch work.
  - OMP: a guarded seat may `write` an exact `local://<name>` file (letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-` and `/`, no `.`
    or `..` segment). That is omp's per-session scratch, which omp itself confines: it refuses absolute paths and
    `..`, and checks real-path containment under the session's local root. Every other `local://` spelling, and
    every other tool, still places a scheme outside.
  - `/tmp` and `xd://report_issue` stay denied. A write denied outside now names the `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` folders as
    the place for scratch files such as a commit message.
  - An `rm` operand the guard cannot read (`$VAR`, `` `…` ``, `{…}`, a relative path after `cd`) gets its own deny
    text, which says to spell the path out literally. The rail still does not resolve shell variables.

## 0.4.4

- **OMP: no subagents from an orchestrator** (#798). Under `SEAT_MODS_ROLE=orchestrator` the omp guard blocks the `task` tool and every `before_subagent_spawn` (eval `agent()`, workpool). Other tools stay free; coordinator and every guarded role are unchanged. The Claude Code hook is unchanged.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-10-14

- **OMP device transport** (#780). Only `write xd://lsp`, `xd://ast_grep` and `xd://github` are checked
  as the inner tool's own call, giving guarded seats their reads and docs. Parsed args with `[` or `.`
  in any key at any depth are denied before dispatch. Transported github `forceWithLease` and `force`
  flags add the force-push rule whenever present with a value other than JSON `false`; direct calls
  are unchanged. Other tools stay denied through `xd://` by outside-write placement. Malformed
  payloads fail closed; `xd://resolve` and `xd://reject` keep their preview-confirmation behaviour.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-10-14

- **The rm rail follows a link before the `..` after it** (#781). Claude Code's path resolve collapses `..` before it
  follows a symlink, so `rm -f <worktree>/link/../x` was placed inside the worktree while the kernel removed `x`
  beside the link's target. Probed live: a guarded implementer removed a file outside its worktree this way. The rm
  rail now walks such a path part by part, as the OMP guard does since 0.4.0 (#762); a `..` above a folder that does
  not exist stays unresolvable and is denied. Write and Edit are unchanged: those tools collapse `..` themselves, so
  the guard's placement already matches where they write.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-13

- Map OMP's `seat-reviewer` child to the reviewer profile, confining its write tool to
  `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`. Keep the bundled `reviewer` and `scout` mappings.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-12

- **OMP guard.** `omp/extension.ts` applies the shared rules (`hooks/rules.ts`) to OMP's
  `tool_call`: `bash`, `write`, `edit`, `ast_edit` and `eval`, in the main session and in `task`
  children. A child is read by agent name: `reviewer` and `scout` get the reviewer rails; `implementer`,
  `task` and any other name get the verifier rails (no commit, push or PR). It loads only through
  `omp-roles`' `omp-seat`. Helper calls inside `eval` are a known limit. The Claude hooks module is
  unchanged.
  A child may not spawn: the `task` tool, eval `agent()` and workpool workers are all blocked
  (`before_subagent_spawn`).
  **An allow list, not a block list.** Under guarded rails a tool call passes only if its name is in
  `GUARDED_TOOLS`, which sorts every tool omp 18.8.9 can expose (its built-in and hidden registries, the edit
  tool's `apply_patch` wire name, and the tools outside them); any other name — `browser`, `computer`,
  `checkpoint`, memory and skill tools, an MCP or extension tool, a tool a later omp adds — is denied with
  one generic message. `ask`, `goal` and `task` are the top-level session's only. `lsp` passes omp's read-only
  actions only, for every guarded role. `github` passes omp's read-only ops; `pr_create` and `pr_push`
  follow the PR and push rails, `pr_checkout` (a worktree and branch outside, `force` resets one) and any
  other op are denied, and `forceWithLease` is a force-push. `debug` runs a program, so only an implementer
  may use it, its launch read like `eval`; a reviewer may not run `eval` either.
  `edit` is placed by every destination it names (`rename`, `edits[]`, hashline `MV`), and
  `bash` rm operands and `-F` files resolve against the call's own `cwd`. omp's advisor and `/tan` clones
  report `kind: "sub"`, so they get the verifier rails even under a coordinator.
  A write target carrying a URL scheme (`local://`, `vault://`, `ssh://`, `xd://<device>`, also `local:/x` and
  `dir/local://x`) is outside under guarded rails, because omp routes it to a host file the worktree check cannot see;
  only `write xd://resolve` and `xd://reject`, which apply or discard an `ast_edit` preview already checked, pass.
  **One omp path reading.** Every write-class target and a `bash` `cwd` go through one normaliser that mirrors
  omp's `expandPath`/`resolveToCwd`: a leading `:`, `@` before `/abs` or `~`, unicode spaces, `file://`, `~`,
  `~/x` and `~user`; a target is also read with write.ts's `[path#HHHH]` header unwrap and the hashline
  quote/tag strip, and an `ast_edit` scope split on `,` `;` and whitespace and placed by its glob's literal
  folder, the strictest reading winning. A `bash` or `debug` `cwd` that is an omp URL (`local://scratch`) is
  outside: `rm` there is denied and a `-F` file there cannot be checked. `rm` operands and `git commit -F` files
  take the same reading in its shell form: a `scheme:/` operand (`rm local://x`) is outside, because omp's
  embedded coreutils route it to the backing file; a `-F` file with a scheme cannot be checked; an unquoted
  `-F ~/msg` is read from HOME (and, since the quotes are not reported, also literally).
  **Known limit:** the guard reads omp's path dialect only as far as listed here. omp's other selectors
  (a SQLite `file.sqlite:table:row`, and any later one) are read as plain paths, so a selector through a
  symlink that points outside the worktree is not caught — the same reach bash writes already have.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-10-09

- **A lone `&` is a command boundary on every `COMMANDS`-split rail** (#723, a fail-open
  guard bypass). `COMMANDS` lacked Bash's background list separator, so `true & git push
  --force`, `echo & git commit -m "…Co-Authored-By: …"` and a `gh pr merge` behind `&` read
  as one command under the first head, and push, force-push, merge, AI-trailer and the
  commit-message reader never saw the second command. `COMMANDS` now splits on a lone `&` —
  the `&` of a `|&` pipe included — while `&&` and the redirections that carry `&`
  (`2>&1`, `>&2`, `&>`, `&>>`, `<&0`, `>&-`) are not boundaries, so the forms the previous
  release allowed keep their rules. Every rail that splits on `COMMANDS` now reads the
  command twice — the shared `COMMANDS` with the expansion mask, and the seat-mods-v0.3.1
  separator with no mask — and denies on the **union** of the two rule sets (and of the two
  `-F` file sets): by construction the rails see everything the previous release saw, plus a
  command after a lone `&`, and the only denies the union adds are the 0.3.1 reading's own.
  The mask itself is narrow: an `&` inside an unquoted `${…}` or `$[…]` expansion is masked
  only when it is a lone `&`, so `(`, `)`, `;` and `|` inside an expansion keep their
  `COMMANDS` meaning, a nested `$(…)` stays executable (`echo ${x:-$(git push --force)}`
  reads `push`, `force-push`), the `&` of a `$(…)` still splits, `$$` is read as one token,
  and an unterminated expansion masks nothing (the split stays, fail closed).
  `X=${x/a&b/c} git push --force` meets its rails as the previous release read it. molt is
  unchanged: its gate reads the shared split once, with no union. The `rm` rail's own split
  is a second spelling of `&` in `rules.ts`: change one and check the others. Known limits
  (#724): an `&` on a heredoc opener line is still swallowed with the heredoc body, a `&&`
  inside an expansion and a backtick substitution inside an expansion keep the previous
  release's reading, and whitespace inside an expansion behind `VAR=` can hide the command.
  The `rm` rail is otherwise unchanged: it already split on `&`.
- Mirrored byte-identically into `molt/hooks/shell.ts` under the shared-reader parity
  contract; `molt` 0.2.5 drops its interim `LONE_AMP` split.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-09

- Every Bash rail now walks the reserved head words already recognised by `rm`, so
  `if git push --force`, `! gh pr merge` and commits behind those heads meet the
  same role and AI-trailer checks as a bare command (#701). Shared parser declarations
  remain unchanged; no new shell forms are parsed. Reserved words are recognised only
  as exact unquoted command heads, so executable paths such as `/tools/if` and head-name
  programs after assignments or execution wrappers remain allowed.
- Heredoc bodies and closing lines supplied to `rm`, including fd-prefixed input
  such as `2<<EOF`, are excluded from operands. Words and redirections after the
  delimiter on the opener line remain part of the command: inside operands are
  allowed and outside operands denied, including after an adjacent redirection.
  Attached operands (`x<<EOF`) retain their checks; non-rm heredocs are unchanged
  (#702 item 1).
- Add molt regression pins for herestrings and path-qualified wrappers, without
  changing molt source or version (#702 item 4). Add allowed controls in the same
  `//`, `/.` and `/..` spellings beside writable-root denial tests (#702 item 5).
- #702 items 2 and 3 and its comment-thread parser limits remain open under the
  PR #644 rule: the matcher grows only for a form that ran in practice.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-08

- Guarded sessions are denied an `rm` the rail recognises when operands are outside their
  writable places. Implementers,
  verifiers and the unmarked default may remove things inside their worktree and `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`;
  reviewers may remove things only inside `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`. Every recognised operand is checked, including
  `-`-prefixed operands after `--`. Writable roots and their ancestors are protected.
- Unresolvable operands are denied, including `rm -rf "$OLDPWD"`, variables, parameter and command
  substitutions, and `~user`. Single-quoted operands are literal; `~` and `~/...` use HOME. Globs
  are placed by their literal prefix directory, so `rm -f /tmp/tmp.*` is denied. Parent symlinks
  resolve, while a terminal symlink is removed literally unless followed by `/`.
- Relative operands use the live `$.session.cwd()` (measured on Claude Code 2.1.294, 2026-10-08;
  see README). Known limit: an earlier recognised `cd`, `pushd` or `popd` in the same Bash call makes a relative
  operand unresolvable even if the change fails. Existing live-cwd worktree detection is unchanged.
- Known limits: `rmdir`, `unlink`, `find -delete`, `git rm`, `git clean`, `xargs rm`, `bash -c '...'`, `mv` over
  a file, and other Bash writes (`cat >`, `sed -i`) remain outside the rail. This is an `rm` matcher
  for mistakes, not precise shell parsing or an adversary boundary. Free roles remain unguarded;
  Bash tool calls from subagents meet the same rail.

- Review round 1: unquoted braces, glob suffix parent traversal and globs above writable roots
  fail closed. Redirections are excluded from operands; single `&`, reserved head words and
  `builtin` are recognised; `builtin cd` and `\cd` affect same-call relative operands. Parsing or
  resolution exceptions deny the Bash call, with self-reference/depth protection for markers.
- Backticks and quoted `$(rm …)` can escape recognition; bare `$(rm …)` is checked by the parentheses splitter.
- A glob component starting with `.` and containing `*`, `?` or `[` is unresolvable and denied.
- Shell options changed in the same call (`shopt`, e.g. `extglob`, `dotglob`, `nullglob`) are not modelled beyond the `**` and dot-component denials.
- `**` in an rm glob operand is unresolvable and denies; quoted literal `**` stays literal.
- An unexecuted shell function body (`cleanup() { rm …; }`) is checked as if it runs and may deny.
- A heredoc given as rm's input (`rm -i x <<EOF`) is read as an extra operand and denied.
- A named descriptor before the command (`{log}>file rm …`) hides the rm.
- One-word runners beyond the recognised wrappers (`timeout`, `nice`, `stdbuf`, `setsid`, `xargs`) can hide `rm`.
- A double-quoted `<<`, or commands after a heredoc opener or a `#` comment on the same line, can hide commands from the rail.
- Paths changed earlier in the same call (`ln -s`, `mv`, `mkdir` before `rm`) are checked against the filesystem as it stands before the call runs.
- Glob matches are not enumerated: a matched parent symlink can lead outside writable places, as in `rm -rf <worktree>/*/node_modules`.
- `$` outside literal quoting/escaping and leading `~+`/`~-` are unresolvable, even when Bash could resolve them.
- Quoted command names such as `"cd"` are not recognised as directory changes.
- `POSIXLY_CORRECT` operand ordering and a backslash-newline inside double quotes are not modelled.

- Review round 2: the existing redirect list includes `<>`, `&>>`, fd duplication/closure and
  `<<<`; herestrings no longer open heredocs. Path-qualified wrappers are recognised, a root
  worktree contains absolute descendants, and unchecked Bash commands get a Bash-specific deny.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-05

Docs only — no code change.

- The rollout guidance now names `herdr-crew` 0.2.7, which marks the two free roles
  (`orchestrator` and `coordinator`) at launch; `paseo-crew`, `orca-crew` and `dsh-crew`
  do not set `SEAT_MODS_ROLE` yet.
- New README section "Without an orchestrator plugin": with none installed you are the
  launcher — worked aliases and functions for the unguarded and guarded roles, and the
  note that a launcher writing `orchestrator` or `coordinator` needs seat-mods 0.2.0 or
  later.
- The README's `claude-review()` example now sets `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`, because a reviewer
  may write only in those directories, and the `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` table row says so for
  the reviewer profile.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-04

- **BREAKING** for unmarked sessions: `SEAT_MODS_ROLE` unset or empty no longer disables the mod —
  the session is guarded as an `implementer` by default, so a forgotten launcher export fails
  closed, and the status line reads `seat: implementer (default: SEAT_MODS_ROLE unset or empty)`.
  Two explicit unguarded roles are added: `orchestrator` (the top orchestrator, or any session
  started to drive work) and `coordinator` (spine, close, work-PR and doctor sessions, lane
  drivers); `implementer`, `verifier` and `reviewer` are unchanged, and any other value still
  denies every tool call. Do not install until every launcher you use — and your own interactive
  sessions — marks its free sessions: a later `herdr-crew` release will; `paseo-crew`,
  `orca-crew` and `dsh-crew` do not set `SEAT_MODS_ROLE` yet; set `SEAT_MODS_ROLE=orchestrator`
  yourself, e.g. in your launch alias. Until then a coordinator or a bare `claude` session starts
  guarded as an implementer and cannot merge. A default-guarded session writes only inside the
  worktree — outside a git repository, its working directory — and the `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`
  directories, so Claude Code's own writes outside them (memory files, plan files) are denied;
  a default-guarded session is a worker, and an operator session marks itself `orchestrator`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-03

- First release. `tool.call` guards per role (implementer, verifier, reviewer), turned on by
  `SEAT_MODS_ROLE` and inert without it; any other value denies every tool call. Writes are checked
  against the worktree and the `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` directories. A commit message file given by `-F` is
