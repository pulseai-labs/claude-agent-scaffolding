#   tests/eval/lib/aggregate-scores.sh   ← ossify's, below its header
#
# The copy's own header states "keep them identical" as a manual ritual, and
# nothing else enforces it: a fix that lands in one copy only leaves the other
# silently behind. It is pinned here rather than in either plugin's suite
# because a plugin suite cannot see its sibling: crew's run-tests.sh reads
# only crew/. A repo-root script sees both trees, which is why this one
# runs from CI's repo-root steps. What the copy CONTAINS is guarded by each
# plugin's own suite; this file guards only that the two still agree.
#
# The eval-library body starts at its first `set ` line in both copies: the
# headers are per-copy by design (crew's carries the porting note), and
# everything below is not.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test-crew-parity.sh
# Deps:  bash 3.2+, diff, sed, jq.
