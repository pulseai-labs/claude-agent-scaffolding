# THE INVENTORY IS THE FILESYSTEM, NOT A MARKETPLACE.
#
# Three rounds of findings landed on this derivation, and each fix moved the blind
# spot instead of closing it, because every source tried was itself a marketplace
# while the failure being caught is a marketplace omission. A hand list missed a
# plugin added to both marketplaces. Deriving from Codex missed one deleted from
# Codex. Comparing Claude against Codex missed one deleted from BOTH — the two
# agreed, and the plugin left every loop below with its manifests still on disk.
#
# The inventory is now the set of top-level directories carrying
# .claude-plugin/plugin.json. That file is the artifact a plugin cannot be
# installed without, not an index of artifacts, so the inventory cannot be
# shortened by editing a marketplace. Both marketplaces are CHECKED against it
# rather than trusted as it.
#
# What this still cannot see: deleting a whole plugin directory. Then the
# inventory, both marketplaces and both manifest sets agree on the smaller set and
# every assertion passes — correctly, since nothing in the repo claims that plugin
# exists any more. Catching that needs an expectation stored outside the tree,
# which is the hand-maintained list this shape exists to remove. A directory
# deletion is also a visible diff hunk, unlike the one-line marketplace edit above.
