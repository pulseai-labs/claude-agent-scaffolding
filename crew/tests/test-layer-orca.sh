# crew — the Orca layer contract, mechanical facts only.
#
# `orca skills get orca-cli` and its --help text are the command reference.
# This reference states only what that guide cannot: the seat launch sequence
# built from agents.md's command:, the one wait, the send, the read, teardown
# and machines — and the traps the 2026-10-18 probes measured.
#
# Several pins are EXACTLY ONCE by design: the launch export carries the child
# marking (`MOLT_HANDOFF=parent`) once (#666/#667 would return with a second
# copy or none), the PING_SEND slot is one send, and the typed wait is one
# call — so a restatement fails its pin rather than passing twice.
#
# Counting is one awk index() pass, hoisted to _helpers.sh with the pin/present
# wrappers (#514, L1): `grep -c` counts LINES, and `… | grep -q` can fail on a
# true match under pipefail.
#
# Usage: bash crew/tests/test-layer-orca.sh
# Deps:  bash 3.2+, awk.
