# crew — the layer boundary, mechanical facts only.
#
# The anti-goal this file exists for (spec §2, §4.1): a herdr command left in a shared file,
# where the next layer would inherit it as an instruction. So the sweep is the point, and it
# prints EVERY hit — a truncated list reads as a shorter job than the one actually left.
#
# Four facts:
#   1. no shared `.md` under skills/orchestrate/ names a layer's commands (`herdr <word>`,
#      `HERDR_`, `orca <word>`) — `references/layers/*` is where those live, and is exempt;
#   2. both layer files carry the thirteen step headings, in order — orca.md equal to herdr.md's;
#   3. a rule true for any layer lives in ONE shared file and in no `layers/*.md` — the
#      anchors in the last section are checked absent from the layer files and present once
#      in their owner, so a layer file cannot accumulate the next layer's copy;
#   4. the orchestration-system verb pair appears nowhere under `crew/` (spec §4.3).
#
# The exemptions are a LIST with a label each, so a task that is done shrinks it rather than
# leaving a hole nobody can see:
#
#   PERMANENT  SKILL.md's frontmatter `description:` line — the trigger words an operator
#              actually types ("the herdr orchestrator session"). Not a command, and the
#              operator's own words are not something a task removes.
#
# T4's envelope entry and T5's identity entry are both gone — the `PING:`/`MOLT:`/`NOTIFY_RUN=`
# lines name the layer's Send (`test-brief-envelope.sh`), and the identity reads are the
# layer's `Identity` (`test-layer-herdr.sh`). Only the PERMANENT one stays.
#
# Usage:   bash crew/tests/test-layer-boundary.sh
# Exit:    0 if every mechanical fact holds; 1 otherwise.
# Deps:    bash 3.2+, find, awk.
