# What is judgment and NOT asserted here: when a seat should be overridden,
# what a condition should say, whether a role belongs at a named point. Those
# are the semantic rubric's.
#
# What IS mechanical: the two file paths, the agent-entry field set, the
# section headings a project file must use, the fallback rule, the halt rule
# for an undefined seat, the readers rule, and the reference budget.
#
# Counting is one awk index() pass, hoisted to _helpers.sh with the pin/present
# wrappers (#514, L1): `grep -c` counts LINES, and `… | grep -q` can fail on a
# true match under pipefail.

# Controls: the spelling half of the coverage claim _helpers.sh makes about
# `count_shadows` — every spelling that comment names has its fixture here, so a
# spelling named there without one is the same defect as a control that stops
# matching. Neither a call nor a comment is a definition, and the last fixture is the
# one that defines none at all. `pin` stands for the six names. Every fixture but the
# last was measured twice: `bash -n` accepts it, and a bash that sources it defines the
# function (`declare -F` finds it). The commented signature is the spelling that
# defeated the first version of the matcher; space-inside-parens and continued-brace
# are the two a delta re-review of the fix found still missing.
