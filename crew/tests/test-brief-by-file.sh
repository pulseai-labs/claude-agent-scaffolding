# crew — briefs go by file, mechanical facts only (#752).
#
# A brief is free text. As a shell argument the shell can word-split it, glob it or run what it
# holds, and a quoting slip in a long brief is easy to make and hard to see. So the layer files
# send a brief by file: the orchestrator writes it under the run's scratch directory and types
# one fixed line, `Read <path> and follow it.`, whose only variable part is a path the
# orchestrator itself made.
#
# Facts:
#   1. no line of SKILL.md, a shared reference or a layer file shows a send command
#      (`herdr agent prompt`, `herdr pane run`, `orca terminal send`) whose argument is a brief
#      placeholder — `<brief>`, `<the brief>`, `<brief text>`. A command whose line ends in a
#      backslash is read together with the next line;
#   2. each layer file shows the fixed pointer line as its send's argument, exactly once.
#
# What this does not claim: the check reads the shipped text, so a send written in words, or a
# placeholder on a line after a command with no continuation backslash, is not seen. It only
# adds a stop. A seat with `host:` on another machine keeps `brief_delivery: inject` (a known
# limit, `config.md`); the layer files describe that in words and show no placeholder for it.
#
# Usage:   bash crew/tests/test-brief-by-file.sh
# Exit:    0 if every fact holds; 1 otherwise.
# Deps:    bash 3.2+, awk, cp, mktemp.
