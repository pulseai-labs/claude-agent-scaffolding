# two readiness paths, the report-file completion contract, and placement.
#
# Counting is one awk index() pass, hoisted to _helpers.sh with the pin/present
# wrappers (#514, L1): `grep -c` counts LINES, and `… | grep -q` can fail on a

# 235, raised from 204 during T3 (2026-09-22): the pilot measured eight mechanics the file
# had wrong or missing — the two detection events, the worktree path's workspace label and
# `result.root_pane.pane_id` and its source-repo `--cwd`, the source-repo workspace that
# `worktree remove` leaves open, the undetected caveat's remedy, the doorbell's generation
# rule and a detected coordinator's `--until blocked` wait beside it, `enter` as the submit
# key, and which ask governs the completion wait. Every addition is a clause: the file went
# 201 -> 233 lines (+32: numstat 56 insertions, 24 deletions) and the gate rose 204 -> 235
# (+31). The gate still fails over the limit; #574's widened doorbell predicate and #575's
# mutually-cancelling companion wait spent the two-line slack (233 -> 235, 2026-09-24).
#
# 204, raised from 200 during PR #513's review rounds: this file's budget is this
# port's own invention (orca-crew has no mechanics reference), and the rounds' P1
# fixes — the run workspace's per-server allocation, the first seat's cwd, the
# agent_blocked re-send — needed room that eight content-neutral trades could not
# keep finding.
# 237, raised from 235 during #574/#575's fix round (2026-09-24): the review's three
# completions — the dispatch-time step now notes what the doorbell compares (the hash and
# the file's identity), the doorbell paragraph refers back to that note instead of
# restating the rule, and a detected coordinator's answered dialog re-arms the pair — added
# two lines, 235 -> 237, to a file that entered the round at its gate (233 -> 235 having
# spent the previous slack). The two lines are mechanics the file exists to state, so the
# gate rose with them; it still fails over the limit.
# 0.2.2 (seat-mods) added the guarded-seat paragraph to the launch's step 2 — the two
# --env flags, the scratch directory and who never gets them: six lines, 237 -> 243,
# again mechanics the file exists to state. The operator-facing rule (never in settings.json)
# first lived only in seat-mods' README. The final review restored it here (spec §5 binds
# both places) with an ossify implementer's handoff directory: two lines, 243 -> 245.
# 0.2.3 (#640) added the worker ping and the heartbeat backstop: the ping line, the
# generation-first consumption rules — including what deduplication does NOT suppress, a
# live dialog and the tick's health check — the wrong-path refusal, and the heartbeat's
# classification and kill points. +27 lines on insertion, traded back 12 (detection events,
# the wait-output caveat, the typed-wait set, the two-dead-ends and doorbell paragraphs, the
# launch intro and steps 1/3/5, and the teardown close paragraph) to land at 260. The gate
# rose with the mechanics the file exists to state and still fails over the limit.
# 0.2.5 (#651 part 5) made step 2 state the guard's own reach — a coordinator's child
# seats and every replacement launch — and list the coordinator classes as unguarded,
# with the status line read at the model read: four lines, 260 -> 264. Fix round 1 put the
# guard in its pane-run form, where the launcher's own shell cannot arm itself, and added
# the replaces: rule: two lines, 264 -> 266.
# 0.2.7 (seat-mods 0.2.0) rewrote step 2 as seat marking — the two free roles' exports, the
# operator's own top, and the #658 fold-ins (<run dir>, the banner status read, the
# missing-status-line route and disposition): the paragraph grew with the mechanics it
# exists to state and the gate rose with it, 266 -> 272. Fix round 1 added the operator-role
# class (guarded as implementer, with its report and scratch directories in SEAT_MODS_ALLOW)
# and the once-only dsh carve-out, deleted the vestigial 0.2.5 binding sentence and reworded
# the guarded sentence's actor: 272 -> 275. The adjacent control runs the same predicate on a
# file one line over the real reference and, when that is accepted, names the remedy (lower
# REF_BUDGET to the real file's count) instead of reading as an over-budget failure.
REF_BUDGET=224  # 2026-10-18 (Task 13): +4 — the machine file's `host:` key now maps to this
# layer's labels in `## Machines`, and that Machines names the cross-machine report read a
# known limit (the route is measured on the Orca layer only).
# 2026-10-18 (T11 ruling A): the layer-neutral OMP-host rules moved to SKILL.md
# §3, where they are stated once with the skill, so the count went 227 -> 220.
# 2026-10-17: crew 0.3.0 Task 4 — the `## Send` section gained the PING_SEND
# slot definition and its one-line statement (3 lines), so the count went 225 -> 228.
