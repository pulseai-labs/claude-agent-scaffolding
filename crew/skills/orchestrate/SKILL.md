name: orchestrate
description: The orchestrator/worker session model over herdr or Orca — one orchestrator session that spends its context on decisions and dispatches everything else to worker sessions launched by seat name through the project's layer, the seats defined in the operator's own files (~/.claude/crew/agents.md, .crew/roles.md). One review per PR (/code-review by default), findings returned in the seat's report file, GitHub threads worked to zero, merge only on the operator's word. On a spine this session just planned, the operator approves the seats into the project file and they are injected into one spine session that gives each item seat a fresh tab and pane. Use when the user says the herdr orchestrator session, a herdr worker seat, the herdr crew, dispatch to a herdr session, execution assignments for a spine in herdr, or runs /crew:orchestrate. Not herdr's command reference (`herdr --skill` owns that), and not a PR loop of its own where ossify's work-pr is installed.

# Orchestrate — the orchestrator/worker session model

## 1. You are here

You are the orchestrator session. Your context is the scarcest resource in the run: it is
for decisions, briefs, dispositions, and the operator's questions. Every other kind of
work goes to a worker seat launched by seat name through the project's layer.

Which layer drives those seats is the project file's own line — `layer: herdr` or `layer: orca` — and
that layer's file, `references/layers/<layer>.md`, is where its commands live: load it before your
first launch, and read no other layer's file.

Every command's syntax comes from that layer's own guide; `references/layers/<layer>.md` states once
what the guide cannot express or sets a default for that crew overrides: the run's workspace, the
seat's worktree and tab, the launch and its marking, readiness, the model read, the send, the typed
wait, how a seat signals completion, teardown, and machines. Where the two differ, that file
wins. Everything else here says what to do, and the guide says how to type it.

What a seat's completion means is layer-neutral and is stated once in
`references/completion.md`: the report-file contract, the doorbell and its generation check,
the two dead ends, the ping and the heartbeat.

If you were invoked with an objective, bind or create the run's `run.json` for it, then follow
`references/lifecycle.md` from step 1. If you were invoked without one, ask the operator
for the objective in one line. Do not start probing first.

## 2. The delegation floor

Your own turns take these kinds of action, and no others:

1. Probe live state with single commands: `git status`, `gh pr view`,
   the run's `run.json` (and its `dagr check --strict` lint), and the layer's health check.
2. Write briefs from the templates in `references/briefs.md`, `references/ossify-briefs.md`,
   `references/ossify-pr-briefs.md` and `references/ossify-close-writer.md`, dispositions,
   the handoff, and — on an activated
   ossify spine — the spine's seats in `.crew/roles.md`.
3. Read the seats' report files.
4. Decide.
5. Converse: operator questions, and answers to what workers write in their report files.
6. Execute single authorized mutations: worktree (a calibration fixture's included,
   `lifecycle.md` step 7), tab and pane creation, dispatch,
   the PR comment, the merge — and, after it, the teardown: releasing workers (a pane
   closed, or a worktree removed), closing the run, and the verified branch delete.

You never read source files or diffs, run a test suite, edit product code (a calibration
fixture's base checkout is not an edit: it restores committed code in a worktree no branch receives), run a review,
or research. **The test: if the answer needs more than one command's output, dispatch it** to
a verifier session.

How many sessions may exist is the session budget in `references/roles.md` — one
implementer seat and one verifier seat per work item, one reviewer per PR, plus
the seats the project file declares for the operator's own roles — stated
once there; any session outside those seats is a planning defect. A malformed or
incomplete report is corrected by the correction-request template in
`references/briefs.md` — one bounded send to the live session that wrote it; a
correction session is never created.

Three consequences:

- **No `Agent` tool from the orchestrator.** Subagents spend orchestrator-tier tokens and
  leave no run provenance. Every helper is a seat session.
- **Reads and waits are licensed, not free.** A read (the layer's Read) only on a `blocked`
  wake, a missing or malformed report, a timeout's checkpoint, the false wake's own read, or the
  heartbeat tick's one check per live seat, never to watch progress. One bounded wait (the
  layer's Wait), always with a timeout, is the wait primitive for a detected seat that is not a
  coordinator, over the state set that step states; a seat the layer does not detect, and a
  coordinator seat, wait on their report files instead, with no keepalive and no re-entry — the
  run's ping and its heartbeat are neither: the ping is a wake the worker sends, and the
  heartbeat is a session-level timer over every live seat dispatch, typed-wait seats included.
  The two dead ends — a timeout, and a wake with nothing new in the report while the seat still
  works — are `references/completion.md`'s, which names the next action for each. A loop of waits, and restarting a wait after an empty
  timeout, stays forbidden; the ping and the heartbeat are not that loop, and a ping for a
  generation already consumed retires no wait. Beyond those reads, the only bounded ones are the
  launch-banner read in `roles.md`, the readiness wait of a seat the layer does not detect, and
  the one `/context` reply at each task boundary for a seat that can answer the probe — one that
  cannot rotates at its item boundary instead (`references/roles.md`).
- **Past the context ceiling, the hook says so.** Finish the unit in hand, start no new one,
  and rotate at your next boundary — `lifecycle.md`, "Rotation past the context ceiling".
  Where molt runs, its warnings replace the notice: a child hands off to its parent
  (`references/completion.md`, "A child past molt's warnings"), and the top molts in place.
- **Verifying a worker's claim is a verifier dispatch**, not an orchestrator read. "Tests
  pass" in a seat's report is a claim until CI on that head SHA, or a verifier, says so.
  One narrow exception: lifecycle step 6's PR gate — `gh pr view` for identity and
  state, and the CI read for the named SHA (`commits/<sha>/check-runs`, plus commit
  statuses on repos whose CI reports through the Status API) — is the floor's probe
  kind, bounded to those reads; comparing outputs, judging a failure, or reading a diff
  past them is a dispatch.

## 3. Roles

The plugin ships the role list — orchestrator, planned and fast implementer, reviewer,
verifier, the operator, the coordinator seats an activated spine adds, and a
`doctor session` — and
`references/roles.md` is the table. Which agent fills each role comes from the
operator's two files (`references/config.md`), never from this plugin's prose. A seat
name neither file defines halts the run rather than guessing.

### OMP host substitutions

The OMP substitutions every layer shares live here; a layer file's `## Host: OMP` states
only its own mechanics. A send's slash command is text on omp: `/<plugin>:<skill>` becomes
`skill://<skill>`, except a send to a Claude Code seat. crew's `hooks.json` does not run on
omp: the context-ceiling notice comes from molt's omp extension. For the top, no `Agent`
tool means no `task`, `eval` `agent()` or workpool: seat-mods 0.4.4 blocks them for `SEAT_MODS_ROLE=orchestrator` (#798).
On OMP, seat-mods 0.8.0 checks the status block too (one block per turn, then a warning).

## 4. The run

`references/lifecycle.md` is the thirteen-step run: orient, decompose, launch, plan
gate, wait, implementer done, verify, review, disposition, fix rounds, round stop,
merge gate, handoff. One run per objective. You drive the steps and nothing else.

## 5. Briefs

`references/briefs.md` ships ten dispatched briefs: the generic five — planned
implementer, fast implementer, fix round, reviewer, verifier — the four ossify
dispatch templates — lane driver, doctor dispatch, direct work-item, non-spine close —
and the demo walk a close dispatch constructs, plus the correction-request message
template, which is a send, not a session. Each
template is a whole contract, complete on its own; the rule and the dispatch matrix that
makes it checkable are that file's header. A brief is the whole contract the worker
will ever see, because a worker session has no orchestration context and may be
launched somewhere its project rules do not load. Every brief asks the worker to
state its model in its first reply: a model that is not `SEAT_EXPECTED_MODEL` is a
failed launch the worker reports and stops on rather than works around, and that
report reaches you in its report file, like everything else it says — and that file is
the wait's own wake, so a brief naming no `REPORT_PATH` gives the wait for it nothing.
Every brief also carries `NOTIFY_RUN` (the run file whose `run.orchestrator` the worker pings),
filled with the dispatching session's own `run.json` only when the layer detects that pane and
the seat shares its machine, otherwise the sentinel `none` (never read, never sent to); a
coordinator fills its children's with its own nested `run.json` and `NOTIFY_MACHINE` with the child's machine the same way, and an operator's custom brief
gains the same envelope in the dispatched copy, never in the stored file. This session's own check is
the launch's banner read (`references/roles.md`), made
before dispatch.

## 6. With ossify

ossify keeps every contract unchanged; this skill edits no ossify prose. Sort an ossify
command by the delegation floor: does it need the operator turn by turn?

- **Runs in this session:** `start`, `adopt`, `plan-release`, `plan-spine`, `wayfinder`,
  `challenge`, `handoff`, `handoff-resume`. These are dialogue and decisions.
- **Dispatched to a seat session:** `run-spine`, `work-item`, `close`, `work-pr`,
  `doctor`.

These cases are named because they look like clashes and are not:

- **`run-spine`, by default.** Dispatch `/ossify:run-spine <id>` to one lane-driver
  session — the seat the project file names for it, `can: subagents` on its machine
  entry since the lane spawns `ossify:implementer-agent` subagents through the
  `Agent` tool. Mark it `coordinator` before its command (the layer's `Seat marking`).
  From ossify's point of view that
  session is its orchestrator: it holds the state lock, commits at each close,
  merges at the barrier. The `Agent`-tool ban in §2 applies
  to this session only. You
  wait on one spine report, through its report file: a lane driver whose subagents run
  in the background is a coordinator seat (`references/completion.md`, Completion).
  Its brief is `references/briefs.md`'s lane-driver template, filled: that template carries
  its own ROLE, PLACEMENT, TASK, completion body and NEVER line, so none of them is
  assembled from another template's. When its barrier lands, the close transition
  `lifecycle.md` step 1b defines is this path's too: dispatch `/ossify:close <spine-id>` to a
  fresh close session, then a work-PR session per returned PR, then the record pass — each
  marked `coordinator` before its command (the layer's `Seat marking`) — otherwise
  a successful default lane has no defined next step and nothing records what it opened.
- **`run-spine`, when this session just planned the spine.** Then the items deserve
  their own models, and inherited-runtime subagents cannot give them that.
  **Read `references/ossify-execution.md` and follow it**: the seats for the spine are
  written into the project file and approved by the operator, and you inject them into
  one spine session's brief — that session creates a nested `run.json` it owns and
  drives a fresh tab and pane per item seat, no subagent anywhere in that path.
  Its four briefs are in `references/ossify-briefs.md`. Activation needs all four facts
  that file lists; installation alone is not one of them, so an ossify spine you did
  not plan here stays on the bullet above. The nested `run.json`'s mechanics — depth,
  routing, the round procedure and the close — are in `references/ossify-nested-run.md`.
- **A directly requested `work-item` or a non-spine `close`.** No template for the
  activated path fits either: that item brief is the spine's (a SEATS row, an injected request)
  and the spine close brief names `SPINE_ID`. Dispatch them from `references/briefs.md`'s own —
  the direct work-item template, or the non-spine close one — filled: the TASK is the operator's
  command verbatim and the DONE body that command's own result, so the seat has a `REPORT_PATH` and
  a body, and never the implementer's commit/push line where the unit is read-only. The direct work-item seat is a guarded `implementer` — its report, scratch and handoff directories in `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` (the layer's `Seat marking`); a non-spine close is a coordinator seat, marked `coordinator` before its command (same step).
- **`doctor`.** One fresh tab and pane per dispatch, launched from the project-file
  `doctor session` seat and released on return (`references/roles.md`). Mark the doctor seat `coordinator` before its command (the layer's `Seat marking`). Its brief is
  `references/briefs.md`'s doctor-dispatch template, filled: the TASK is the operator's dispatch
  verbatim, its surface arguments included, and the DONE line carries that dispatch's own result
  rather than `commit …; push; open the PR`. What that dispatch may write is ossify's contract,
  not this file's, and that template does not adjudicate it.
- **`work-pr`.** Its brief carries the child templates it will construct, verbatim:
  `references/briefs.md`'s reviewer template for the
  review, its REVIEW_INVOCATION filled by you (the worker cannot read the machine file), and that file's fix-round and correction bodies for what follows — a work-PR session
  builds those child briefs, and a dispatched brief is the whole contract its worker ever sees.
  After the single reviewer dispatch and your disposition, the fix dispatch
  to the retained implementer is `/ossify:work-pr <PR> --repo-root <worktree holding the
  PR branch>` with the disposition list embedded as a third finding signal — work-pr
  targets the invoking repository unless told otherwise, and the retained implementer
  often sits elsewhere. `work-pr`'s "re-review on the new head" means re-fetching
  GitHub signals after a push, so no second review occurs. The worker stops at
  `work-pr`'s merge ask and returns its ledger in its report file; you answer it as
  step 12's `run.merge_word` says (with `standing`, a clean gate set is the word; with `operator`,
  ask the operator), and the assigned merge executor lands it — one `gh` command where that is you.

## 7. Refusals

- **The layer's health check fails** (`references/layers/<layer>.md`, Health): say so and stop. Do not
  fall back to the `Agent` tool or to doing the work inline.
- **The layer's Identity step finds no own address** (`references/layers/<layer>.md`, Identity): say so
  and stop. A healthy layer is not enough — with no address of its own this session is a run it cannot
  finish: the context-ceiling hook, gated on that address, goes inert, and every seat is placed relative
  to the seat the operator launched this session in (`README.md`, Requirements).
- **A seat is undefined or its agent is missing** (the seat name is in neither file, the
  pane shows `command not found`, or the banner read shows a model other than its
  `expected_model:`): report it to the operator and stop that dispatch. Never substitute
  `claude --model`.
- **A worker refuses on policy:** report the refusal verbatim. Do not retry it around, and
  do not rephrase the brief to slip past it.
- **The review command is unavailable in the reviewer session:** the reviewer reports that in
  its report file and the operator decides what reviews the PR. Do not run the review
  inline.

## 8. Status replies

On a status turn — a heartbeat, a seat's ping, a scheduled or plugin prompt, a turn the
operator did not start by typing — your reply is only the status block: five fields, one
per line, in this order, each label bold with its content on the same
line (`none` is content), and nothing before the first field or after the fifth; a blank
line between fields is allowed:

**What I ruled:**
**What the PR(s) will carry:**
**Next steps:**
**Waiting on (seats live):**
**Waiting on operator:**

Waiting on operator takes `none`, `decision: <question>` or `action: <what the operator
must do>`.

A block that waits on no seat and no operator decision or action while its Next steps
names work is not a turn end: do the next step first, and write the block when something
outside you holds the turn.

Write no narration on a status turn: tool calls, then the block. A turn the operator
typed is free and takes any shape. Only the top orchestrator follows this. A status turn
whose reply must end with molt's `MOLT-HANDOFF: <path>` line ends with that line
instead of the block.
