# Roles

One session owns each active role. A session's name or suffix is not its identity: when
resuming, ask each candidate to state its role and assignment and wait for the reply
before sending work.

The seat names below are examples: the project file (`.crew/roles.md`,
`references/config.md`) is the authority for which agent fills each role.

| Role | Seat | Effort | Lifetime | Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | you — the operator launched this session | | one per run | |
| Implementer, planned | `strong-coder` | the seat's — a marked item or a retry fills a higher-effort seat the project file's conditions name, and the machine entry is the only source of effort: never the same command edited | retained across work items and the PR's fix rounds, to the threshold below | `contract`: an interface, schema, contract, or architectural change, or a plan gate; the default when the item is not `bounded` |
| Implementer, fast | `fast-coder` | the seat's | retained if a fix round follows, else released | `bounded` only when the item is one-file, mechanical, or read-only |
| Reviewer | `sonnet-review` — once per PR; first task its review command (`/code-review <PR> <LEVEL>` by default, `config.md` `review:`); never implements | the seat's | disposable; released after its report file validates | |
| Verifier | `strong-coder` — the work-item verify; `fast-coder` for read-only probes and mechanical runs outside it (a suite, a count, a fact) | the seat's | retained until its item passes or escalates to the operator | |
| Operator | the human — the merge word, and decisions no session can own | | | |

The layer's own answer decides a seat's wait path, so where the project file offers a choice,
prefer an agent the layer detects (a `claude-*` lane, `pi`) for the implementer and
verifier roles: the typed wait then covers a live state instead of the report file alone. An
undetected seat stays legal — it is waited on through its report file and pings like any
other — and no profile field declares the path: detection is read live at launch.

## The launch

A seat is a name, never `--model`. The command it resolves to lives in the operator's
machine file; run-time surfaces carry the name only, and a name neither file defines
halts the run. **Both files must exist before this sequence is run**: a seat's role
resolves through the project file and its launch command through the machine file, so
with either absent there is nothing to resolve — that state is `config.md`'s, its
"When a file is missing", not a decision this sequence makes. The launch is this sequence
of the layer's steps, and only the layer's file holds their commands and flags:

1. **Run workspace** — the run's workspace, once per run per server that hosts a seat.
2. **Seat worktree** — the seat's tab, and a new worktree where the seat needs one.
3. **Seat launch** — the tab's pane, the launch environment below, and the seat's command.
4. **Readiness** — the wait the pane's kind takes.
5. **Read** — the model read that confirms `expected_model:`.
6. **Send** — the brief, as `brief_delivery` says.

**A seat on another machine.** A machine entry that names a `host:` (`config.md`) runs
every step above on that machine, through the layer's Machines step: its workspace, its
worktree, its pane and its report file all live there, and its report is read where it was
written. A seat with no `host:` runs here.

**The launch environment.** `Seat marking` writes these into the seat's pane, before the seat's
command, in one export; every layer sets the same names and meanings, because the mods read
them and never ask which layer set them. A guarded seat — implementer, verifier or reviewer —
is marked by its launcher, before its command, with

    SEAT_MODS_ROLE=<role> SEAT_MODS_ALLOW=<REPORT_PATH's directory>:<its scratch directory> MOLT_HANDOFF=parent MOLT_STATUS_PATH=<REPORT_PATH>.molt-status AUTONOMIC_LEDGER=<ledger> AUTONOMIC_PAIN_PATH=<REPORT_PATH>.autonomic-pain

plus `AUTONOMIC_MODE=autopilot` where the autonomic marking below says. The names mean:

- `SEAT_MODS_ROLE` — the seat's role: `implementer`, `verifier` or `reviewer` for a guarded
  seat, `coordinator` for a coordinator seat, `orchestrator` for the top's rotation successor.
  A project-file role whose `replaces:` names one of those guarded roles is guarded as that role;
  one with no `replaces:` is a guarded `implementer`, its own report directory and its
  scratch directory in its `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`.
- `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` — the colon-separated paths a guarded seat may write: its report directory
  and its scratch directory. A coordinator seat — the spine, close or work-PR session, the
  doctor session, the lane driver — exports the same list with `SEAT_MODS_ROLE=coordinator` **in
  place of** `<role>` and no `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`: every other assignment on it is unchanged. The
  top's rotation successor's is that variant with `SEAT_MODS_ROLE=orchestrator`. The operator's
  own first top is not launched here — the operator starts it through a `claude-orch` alias
  that sets `orchestrator`. A coordinator takes none, except an OMP coordinator (`config.md`),
  which adds each hosting repo's `.worktrees` root.
- `MOLT_HANDOFF=parent` and `MOLT_STATUS_PATH=<REPORT_PATH>.molt-status` — every guarded seat, every coordinator seat and every operator-declared role. The operator's first top and the top's rotation successor are roots and take neither. What the marking does is `completion.md`'s ("A child past molt's warnings").
- `AUTONOMIC_LEDGER` and `AUTONOMIC_PAIN_PATH=<REPORT_PATH>.autonomic-pain` — the run's one
  ledger, an **absolute** path outside every worktree, and the seat's pain file; the top's
  successor takes `AUTONOMIC_LEDGER` and no pain path, since it has no parent.
- `AUTONOMIC_MODE=autopilot` — only when the launcher is itself in autopilot.

Never in `settings.json`'s `env`, a shell profile or a `command:` line. The scratch directory,
created first, is `<run dir>/scratch/<role>-<n>` — `<run dir>` the directory holding the run's
`run.json`, outside every worktree — with no `:` or space in either directory, as `:` separates
the list. An ossify implementer's list adds its handoff's directory; a brief with scratch work
names it `SCRATCH_DIR`. The layer's `Seat launch` says how its own command sets all of this.

**The model read's status line.** The model read of a guarded seat also reads its status line
for `seat: <role>`; its absence there means no guards — a coordinator records that in its report
file (to the top), the top records one from its own launches to the operator, and a missing
status line halts no seat, re-launches none and is never silently dropped. The layer's step says
which read carries it.

**autonomic marking.** The same export adds `AUTONOMIC_LEDGER=<ledger>
AUTONOMIC_PAIN_PATH=<REPORT_PATH>.autonomic-pain` for every child the molt marking reaches, and
`AUTONOMIC_MODE=autopilot` only when the launcher is itself in autopilot. `<ledger>` is the
launcher's own `$AUTONOMIC_LEDGER` when set, else `<run dir>/autonomic-ledger.md`: one ledger
per run, outside every worktree. A relative launcher value is first
resolved against the launcher's own repo root, as autonomic resolves it, never passed on as
written: a relative path resolves inside each seat's worktree and dies with it, and with none
the ledger lands in the worktree and rides the seat's commits. The export quotes nothing, so an
inherited path is passed on only when every character is a letter, a digit, `.`, `_`, `/` or
`-`; any other is not passed on: the child gets `<run dir>/autonomic-ledger.md` instead.
`<run dir>` and `REPORT_PATH` are crew's own choice and keep to the same characters. The
launcher's mode is autonomic's live mode, read at each launch — on Claude Code, `printf %s
"$AUTONOMIC_EFFECTIVE_MODE"`, set by autonomic 0.4.0 on every mode change. An OMP launcher (an
`omp-seat` coordinator) reads `cat "$AUTONOMIC_MODE_FILE"` (autonomic 0.7.0), because omp's bash
children keep the environment from session start. Exactly `autopilot` marks the child; anything
else (unset, missing file, older autonomic) does not. It is never `$AUTONOMIC_MODE`, the spawn's
input: the top may be in autopilot by `/autopilot on` or a molt's lineage, which that never
shows, or may have been refused it. It is never the record file either: one that failed to
write can still read `autopilot` after a fall to manual. `autopilot` marks the child; anything
else, unset included, leaves `AUTONOMIC_MODE` unset. A manual seat writes neither file, so the
two paths cost nothing. An autopilot seat's scope is its brief; it gets no `/autopilot on`. Its
first permission ask, and the first after a clear, has nothing to judge and waits for a human,
so a seat meant to run unattended needs a `command:` whose permission mode does not ask
first — the operator's file, never a launch-time edit. `AUTONOMIC_BELL` is never set: the pain
file reaches the parent. The top's rotation successor takes `AUTONOMIC_MODE` and
`AUTONOMIC_LEDGER` by the same rule and no pain path, since it has no parent; the operator's
first top takes none. A respawn reads the launcher's mode again.

**A molt is not a launch.** The top's in-place molt (`lifecycle.md`, "Where molt runs") keeps
the pane's process and its exports, so its `orchestrator` marking stands across the clear, and
seat-mods reads the role from the environment on every tool call. The status-line check belongs
to the launch read; a later read that finds no `seat: <role>` after a molt is not a missing
marking. A respawned child is a launch: this runs again in full — a fresh export naming its new
`MOLT_STATUS_PATH`, its `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW` rebuilt, and the status-line read, a missing
`seat: <role>` recorded as at any launch.

This file states only the role table and retention. Acceptance of input is not the start of a
turn: the send's own check confirms the turn started in the same call, and the layer's Send
says what to do when it did not. A stalled or timed-out send is never sent again to prove
delivery — a stall does not prove non-delivery — and the state it left is read instead. A wrong model is a failed launch: release the seat and report
it. Every brief also asks the worker to state its model in its first reply — the second
check, and the worker's own: one that finds its model is not `SEAT_EXPECTED_MODEL` reports
a failed launch in its report file and stops, rather than working around it.

## Retention follows artifacts

**Enrolled OMP override:** retention preserves a pane/artifact lineage, not permission to hot-enroll its running agent. A materially new task ends the process and takes fresh trusted issuance/launch. A correction or re-check may reuse only the same assignment and unchanged approval/grants/lifetime. All role profiles remain ceilings, never grants; operator-owned merge/design/plan gates and seat-mods denials win. Completion/revocation invalidates old authority. Generic switch or an in-place Molt without independently distinguishable public ownership evidence remains suspended and needs fresh trusted launch; parent-handback children end their unit. The legacy/Claude Code retention paragraphs below are unchanged.

The session that built the PR fixes the PR, and an implementer is retained across
consecutive work items. No ownership transfer exists: retain a seat by keeping its
pane and sending it the next task's brief (the layer file says how). At each task
boundary the context probe is `/context`, for a seat whose profile can run a local slash
command (`can: slash-commands`, `config.md`): send it and read the one reply with
the model read (the layer's Read) — the orchestrator's one context source: past half its window, as
`/context` reports, or an auto-compact, the next item goes to a fresh implementer. That
probe is the mechanism for the seats that can answer it, and a seat is sent one only when
both hold: its profile can run a local slash command, and the send route that reaches it —
the second detection ask's answer (`layers/<layer>.md`) — carries one. A seat failing
either condition — a profile without the capability, or a pane that ask finds undetected —
is never sent the probe, and rotates at its item boundary instead, on the run's own record:
the item it has just finished, not a probe it cannot answer. The
implementer returns its handoff inputs in its report file; the orchestrator writes the
handoff into the next brief. Rotation happens between work items, never mid-PR: the
retained implementer finishes the PR's fix rounds unless the harness auto-compacts or molt
warns it (`completion.md`, "A child past molt's warnings").
The reviewer owns nothing durable and is released the moment its report file is
processed; the verifier seat is retained across a fail-and-fix cycle on the same item
— the re-check attaches its task to the same verifier — and is released only when the
item passes or goes to the operator. A seat is released as the Teardown order below says —
the same section that states the source repository's workspace a worktree seat leaves open,
which the run did not create and does not close.

## The activated-ossify-spine exception

On a spine this session planned (`ossify-execution.md`), two rows above are
superseded **for that spine's work items only**: the implementer and the verifier
are launched from the spine's operator-approved SEATS rows, whose values may name
a native `claude --model <id> --effort <level>` command rather than an alias; the
model is confirmed as the row's `model_shows` says and by the worker's own check, exactly
as *The launch* requires; and each item gets a
**fresh** pair, retained across that item's corrections and released when it closes or
escalates. A pair never crosses work items there. The session that launches the seat
marks it in the pane, before its command, as the layer's `Seat marking` states.

Everything else on this page — the class routing, the retention rule, the placement
and writer rules, and the budget below — is unchanged and still governs every session
outside such a spine. The spine session itself is launched **from the `spine session` seat the project file names**
for that spine — marked `coordinator` before its command (the layer's `Seat marking`) —
so the generic lane-driver policy does not select it.

## Session budget

One implementer seat and one verifier seat per work item; one reviewer per PR. A fix
round may re-use the verifier seat, and a context-rotation replacement occupies the
seat it replaces. Any session outside those seats is a planning defect: stop and
re-plan the item. A further read-only question goes to the existing verifier or
implementer as a send, never to a new session.

One further seat the budget admits on declaration, and only for its declared span:
a role the operator pins to a named point occupies a seat for that point's
dispatch — launched when the run reaches the point, released when the role
returns, blocking or advisory — and an `at: on-demand` role occupies a seat for
the dispatch it was wanted for, against the allowance the project file declares,
one at once by default. A declared role past that allowance, or a declared-role
seat lingering past its span, is the planning defect the rule still catches.

**Activated ossify spines add four seats, all outside the per-item budget above:
the spine session, one per spine; a close
session, a fresh tab and pane per close dispatch; a work-PR session, one per returned
PR — each launched from its own seat in the project file (`spine session`,
`close session`, `work-PR session`), marked `coordinator` before its command
(the layer's `Seat marking`), the model confirmed as its profile's
`model_shows` says and by the worker's own check, as an item row's is — and a close-review writer,
one per affected hosting repo at a `halted: close-review`, launched from the profile the operator
names at that halt (`ossify-close-writer.md`), never a seat the file pre-defines.** The
work-PR session owns the reviewer and the
PR-fix seat inside a `run.json` of
its own, so those two are budgeted there rather than here — the top decides both
profiles at the PR transition and injects them, and neither survives the merge. No
implementer is retained into a spine PR: every item pair was released at its item's
close. None of these seats exists anywhere else. A `doctor session` — one fresh
tab and pane per `/ossify:doctor` dispatch, released on return — sits outside the
budget too, launched from the project-file seat of the same name, marked `coordinator`
before its command (the layer's `Seat marking`).

## Placement

In a dual-repo workspace, the orchestrator and implementers launch from the AI workspace
and address canonical worktrees explicitly, because a session launched inside the
canonical repo never loads the workspace's rules, memory, or handoffs. Reviewer and
verifier may launch inside a canonical worktree for a fresh frame, which is why their
briefs are self-contained. Single-repo projects launch everything in the repo or a
worktree of it.

## Writers

- **One writer per artifact.** A correction to a peer's file travels as a send, never as
  a direct edit.
- **One implementer per worktree.** Two writers never share a checkout. Parallel items
  get parallel worktrees.
- **The orchestrator writes briefs, dispositions, and handoffs.** It writes no product
  file.

## Teardown order

Close only what the run created: a seat's pane or worktree, and the run's own workspace
closes last, after every workspace linked to it. A worktree seat is released once its branch's
work is safe — the implementer's after `lifecycle.md` step 12's merged-branch check, the
reviewer's (it edits nothing) once its report file validates (step 8). Read every receipt — a
failed call reports on stderr and exits nonzero — and confirm against the layer's listing,
never assume: a last pane's close may take its tab and workspace too, and a target already gone
is information, not failure. A refused remove goes to the operator, never a forced one. The
source repository's workspace a worktree seat leaves open was not created by the run and the
operator closes it, never the run (in the dual-repo case the canonical checkout). The layer's
`Teardown` step holds the commands.
