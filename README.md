</p>

The plugins we run every day to ship real software with coding agents (Claude Code, Codex and
OMP), from one marketplace.

Instead of jumping straight to code, **ossify** starts from a skeleton: a thin slice that runs end
to end on a new project, or the code that already shipped on an existing one. Then it grows that
skeleton spine by spine. Each work item is built test-first, checked by an agent that did not build
it, and reviewed before it merges. Most of the other plugins plug into that loop; the rest work
beside it.

`/ossify:work-pr` runs merge-bar's PR loop where merge-bar is installed, and ossify's own loop
otherwise. The full command set is in [ossify's README](./ossify/README.md).

## How the plugins fit together

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/readme/plugin-hub-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/plugin-hub-light.svg" width="880" alt="ossify at the centre. Solid arrows: ossify starts merge-bar for PR review and merge; baton runs a spine on a timer; crew runs seats over a spine; molt hands off context with ossify:handoff; workspace-init sets up the workspace first and is optional. Dashed lines: sage, remodel and membrane are used beside ossify.">
</picture>

A solid arrow marks a plugin that works with ossify inside the lifecycle, and it points away from
the side that starts the work. A dashed line marks a plugin you use beside ossify: ossify does not
call it and works without it.

## One AI workspace, clean product repos

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/readme/dual-repo-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/dual-repo-light.svg" width="880" alt="One AI workspace holds specs, plans, handoffs, the memory bank, the review ledger and the pairing manifest, and manages one or more canonical repos that hold product code, tests and ADRs.">
</picture>

Agent process stays out of your product history. Specs, plans, handoffs and the review record live
in one AI workspace; code, tests and ADRs land in the canonical repos it manages, one or
more. `/workspace-init:init-workspace` sets the pair up and writes the pairing manifest.
workspace-init's job ends there: its continuation for new workspaces is `ossify`.
workspace-init is optional for ossify:
`/ossify:start` and `/ossify:adopt` can write `.ossify/topology.json` themselves.

## Install

Built for Linux and macOS; CI runs on Linux.

<details open>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

```
/plugin marketplace add github:pulseai-labs/pulsestack
/plugin install ossify@pulsestack
/plugin install merge-bar@pulsestack
/plugin install sage@pulsestack
/plugin install remodel@pulsestack
/plugin install membrane@pulsestack
/plugin install crew@pulsestack
/plugin install seat-mods@pulsestack
/plugin install molt@pulsestack
/plugin install baton@pulsestack
```

`workspace-init` is **optional** for ossify: `/ossify:start` and `/ossify:adopt`
author `.ossify/topology.json` themselves. Install it when you also want the
dual-repo bootstrap and the AI-trace commit-msg filter; ossify reads its
`pairing.json` as a fallback.

```
/plugin install workspace-init@pulsestack
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

Codex support is dual-published from the same repo through
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. The Codex marketplace exposes:

- `workspace-init`
- `sage`
- `membrane`
- `remodel`
- `crew`
- `merge-bar`
- `ossify` (rounds are driven from Claude Code, which registers the
  implementer subagent — Codex does not)

```
codex plugin marketplace add github:pulseai-labs/pulsestack
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OMP</b></summary>

OMP reads `.omp-plugin/marketplace.json`, which lists the plugins whose procedures do not depend on
the harness (`ossify`, `merge-bar`, `workspace-init`, `remodel`, `sage`), the
mods (`seat-mods`, `molt`), the shared `crew` and the OMP-only `omp-roles`.

    omp plugin marketplace add pulseai-labs/pulsestack

    omp plugin install ossify@pulsestack   # and each plugin you want

OMP does not put a plugin's `bin/` on `PATH`. Install the extension that does, once per machine, in your
user extension folder; OMP loads it in every session:

    curl -fsSL --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pulseai-labs/pulsestack/main/omp/extensions/plugin-bin-path.ts \
      -o ~/.omp/agent/extensions/plugin-bin-path.ts

If you set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, the folder is `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions/` instead; change the `-o` path to match.

The file is a small loader: the logic ships inside the plugins, so `omp plugin upgrade` keeps it current,
and the loader warns with this command if it ever needs a new download. Without it, `oss`, `wi`, `mb` and `crew-run`
are not found and the skills that need them say so. A session started
with `--no-extensions` needs `-e <that file>`.

Guarded seats: install `omp-roles` and both mods, then launch with `omp-seat` (the extensions load only
through it). Link its `bin/omp-seat` onto `PATH` as `omp-roles/README.md` shows. It needs `bun`, and `seat-mods` and `molt` at the minimum versions `omp-roles/README.md` names; with an older or missing install it refuses and names the version it needs.

    omp plugin install omp-roles@pulsestack   # and seat-mods, molt
    omp-seat worker --via omp -p "..."

`omp-roles` is pinned and tested on omp 18.16.0 (`omp-roles/README.md`).

<summary><b>Renamed from claude-agent-scaffolding: move a machine</b></summary>

This marketplace had the name in the line above until November 2026. Three plugins were renamed
with it: `code-judo` is now `remodel`, `ai-mentor` is now `sage`, and `claude-security-audit` is now
`membrane`. Every other plugin keeps its name. Behaviour is unchanged; only install keys and command
namespaces (`/remodel:…`, `/sage:…`, `/membrane:…`) moved. The old GitHub URL redirects here.

To move a machine, for each harness you use:

1. **Claude Code.** First note each enabled plugin and its scope: `enabledPlugins` in
   `~/.claude/settings.json` (user), and in each project's `.claude/settings.json` (project) and
   `.claude/settings.local.json` (local). Then copy the data, before anything is removed, because
   uninstalling a plugin deletes its data directory. That directory,
   `~/.claude/plugins/data/<plugin>-<marketplace>/`, carries the marketplace name: copy each old one into
   its `-pulsestack` twin (for a renamed plugin, under the new plugin name). Then run `/plugin marketplace remove claude-agent-scaffolding`,
   then `/plugin marketplace add pulseai-labs/pulsestack`, and install the same plugins as
   `<plugin>@pulsestack` in the scope you noted (`claude plugin install <plugin>@pulsestack --scope project`
   or `--scope local`; user is the default), with the three new names in place of the old.
2. **Codex.** Run `codex plugin marketplace remove claude-agent-scaffolding-codex`, then
   `codex plugin marketplace add pulseai-labs/pulsestack`, and enable the same plugins. Hook-trust
   entries in `~/.codex/config.toml` are keyed by `plugin@marketplace`, so re-trust them under
   `pulsestack-codex`.
3. **OMP.** Run `omp plugin marketplace remove claude-agent-scaffolding`, then add `pulseai-labs/pulsestack`
   and install the same plugins, then download the bin-path loader again (the `curl` line under
   the OMP block above). Relink anything on `PATH` that pointed into the old plugin cache (for example `omp-seat`).

For one release, the OMP bin-path module and loader also read installs under the old marketplace
name (`marketplace remove` not run yet), so a machine keeps working until it moves.
