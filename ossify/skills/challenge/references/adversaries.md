# The adversary ladder

Depth for `challenge/SKILL.md`, loaded by audit mode at close depth. A
close-depth audit recruits one external fresh-frame adversary. **Which one is
configuration, not code** — and unconfigured means host-only, by declaration,
not by accident.

---

## 1. Resolution — first hit wins

1. **Per-invocation override.** The calling prose or the user names an
   adversary for this run.
2. **`OSSIFY_ADVERSARY`** — `codex`, `claude`, or the literal `none` (force
   host-only even where a recipe would resolve).
3. **Host-only.** The declared default. No implicit adversary is ever assumed
   from the host agent.

**Any other value resolves to a loud refusal, not an improvisation:** an
unvalidated name (`droid`, `gemini`, anything not in §2) gets one plain line —
*"<name> has no validated recipe — running host-only; see
challenge/references/adversaries.md §2 for how a recipe is added"* — and the
audit continues host-only. Selecting a name whose invocation nobody has
validated would hand the audit to a guessed command line.

Audit mode announces the resolution before running (audit.md §3), and the
summary's `Adversaries used` line always names what actually ran — `host only`
is a value, not an omission.

---

## 2. Recipes

Each recipe: a probe, an invocation, the output contract (§3), a timeout, and
the failure path (§4). `codex` and `claude` are ported verbatim from
architect-critic 0.6.0's proven invocations; they are the complete validated
set. A third entry joins only after a real run proves it (§2.1).

**Every invocation runs under the timeout guard (§2.2) — an unguarded hang is
a blocked ceremony.** And both resolve the schema path **before entering
Bash**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is not exported into Bash-tool subprocesses
(it expands to empty there — `doctor/references/budget-check.md` documents the
behaviour). Resolve from the `oss` dispatcher, and **account for the OpenCode
wrapper**: on that surface `command -v oss` finds `.opencode/bin/oss`, whose
parent is the bundle package, not the plugin — the plugin sits one level
further up, beside it. Two steps, loud on failure:

```bash
oss_bin="$(command -v oss)"
plugin_root="$(cd "$(dirname "$oss_bin")/.." && pwd)"          # direct install
schema="$plugin_root/skills/challenge/templates/output-schema.json"
[ -f "$schema" ] || { plugin_root="$(cd "$(dirname "$oss_bin")/../.." && pwd)/ossify"  # OpenCode wrapper
                      schema="$plugin_root/skills/challenge/templates/output-schema.json"; }
[ -f "$schema" ] || { echo "cannot locate the challenge schema from $oss_bin"; exit 1; }
```

### codex — ported, proven

**Probe:** `command -v codex`.

**Invocation** (the schema file ships at
`skills/challenge/templates/output-schema.json` under the plugin root):

```bash
codex exec --json \
  --output-schema "$schema" \
  --output-last-message "<tmpdir>/codex-audit-<id>.json" \
  --ignore-user-config --ignore-rules --skip-git-repo-check \
  "<prompt>"
```

Read the `--output-last-message` file, not stdout. Validate it against §3.

### claude — ported, proven

**Probe:** `command -v claude`.

**Invocation:**

```bash
claude --print \
  --output-format json \
  --json-schema "$(cat "$schema")" \
  --permission-mode dontAsk \
  --no-session-persistence \
  "<prompt>"
```

Validate the response against §3.

### 2.1 Adding a recipe

`droid` is the expected next entry, and the reason it is not selectable yet is
the point: a recipe ships only after a real audit run validates its exact
flags against the installed CLI. To add one: run one close-depth audit with
the candidate CLI, confirm the final message satisfies §3, then add the
section — probe, invocation, timeout, failure path — in the same change. A
name without a validated invocation is a dead selector, not a recipe.

### 2.2 The timeout guard

`OSSIFY_ADVERSARY_TIMEOUT_S` (integer seconds, default **300**) bounds every
recipe invocation:

- **GNU `timeout` or `gtimeout` present** — run the invocation under
  `timeout "$OSSIFY_ADVERSARY_TIMEOUT_S" <invocation>`. Exit 124 is the
  timeout signature.
- **Neither present (macOS default)** — run the invocation in the background,
  sleep-and-poll for completion, and `kill` it once the limit passes. The
  exit status of a killed run is the timeout signature.

A timeout lands in §4 like any other failure: one warning naming the cause,
audit continues host-only. **Never invoke an adversary without the guard** —
the timeout documented beside a recipe is a promise this section is what
keeps.

---

## 3. The return contract — travels in the prompt

The adversary never sees this skill, so the contract is embedded in the prompt
verbatim, as an ordinary fenced block — with **one legal severity value in
the example** (an alternation literal like `premise|gap|alternative` is not a
legal enum value, and a schema-constrained model may echo it back):

    ## Return contract
    Return a JSON object of exactly this shape:
    ```json
    {"challenges":[{"text":"<one paragraph>","severity":"gap","rationale":"<why>"}]}
    ```
    severity is one of: premise, gap, alternative.

Validation: a JSON object with a `challenges` array whose items each carry
string `text`, `severity` in `premise|gap|alternative`, and string `rationale`.
Anything else is invalid output and takes the §4 path.

**Size cap before dispatch.** The prompt travels as one command-line argument,
and argv limits (roughly 2 MB, less after environment overhead) fail the
process before the adversary starts — a silent loss of the fresh frame. If the
assembled prompt exceeds **128 KiB**, do not dispatch: run host-only with one
warning naming the artifact's size and the cap. §1's 50K-line check surfaces
oversized artifacts earlier; this cap is the mechanical backstop.

---

## 4. Failure is host-only, loudly

Timeout, non-zero exit, missing file, invalid JSON, over-cap prompt — all five
land in the same place: **one warning naming the cause, the audit continues
host-only, and the summary records what actually ran.** Never retry
mid-ceremony; never treat a failed adversary as a passing one. The user
re-runs the audit after fixing the cause if the fresh frame matters for this
artifact.
