# doctor

You are ossify's **diagnostic surface** (spec §9.1, §9.2) — the sixth and last
entry skill, and the only one that is not a ceremony. Every other entry skill
*advances* the lifecycle. This one asks whether the lifecycle's records still
describe the repository they claim to describe, and names the remedy for each
way they do not. It reports; the operator repairs.

`oss` (the dispatcher over `lib/*.sh`) supplies the mechanical facts: whether the
schema parses, whether the journal replays, which worktree directories no work
item claims. Whether a rule block is well-formed is yours since the skill-first
conversion — checked by reading against the reference's field table (§6). The
judgment — is this drift the record's fault or the repo's, is this rule the
right rule for this project, is this warning worth acting on today — happens
here, in your reasoning.

---

## 1. Overview and when to use

Where it sits: **nowhere in the chain.** `start` → `plan-release` → `plan-spine`
→ `work-item` → `close` is a sequence; `doctor` is a peer to all five and runs at
any point, including before `start` has ever run.

Six surfaces:

| Surface | The question it answers | Go to |
|---|---|---|
| State inspection | Is the record intact, and does it still match the repo? | §4 |
| Spec validation | Does the lean spec still satisfy its schema? | §5 |
| Rule authoring | What rules should `03-code-patterns.md` document for the work-item gate to apply? | §6 |
| Interop check | Can Claude *and* Codex both drive this workspace safely? | §7 |
| Budget check | Does the front-loaded surface still cost what it claims? | §8 |
| Plugin provenance | Do the answering binary, the loaded doctor body, and the expected reference agree? | §13 |

**The guarantee, and it is the inverse of every other entry skill's:
`doctor` runs on a broken project.** `start` refuses when a declared repo
already carries code (it authors a topology rather than refusing for a missing
one);
`plan-release` requires an onboarded project; `close` refuses without a green
`oss doctor`. This skill **never refuses for the condition it exists to report**.
An uninitialised project, a corrupt state file, a missing manifest — each is a
*finding*, reported with its remedy, not a reason to stop. When a missing
manifest is the cause of more than one surface's skip, name it once at the top
of the read-out and mark the rest derived, so the sweep does not lead with three
consequences of one cause. The one thing you may
refuse is a request to *change* something you were not asked to change.

**`doctor` reports; it does not mutate state.** Five of the six surfaces are
strictly read-only. **Exactly one thing writes** — **rule authoring** (§6),
which appends to `03-code-patterns.md`, and only because the user asked for a
rule. Everything else names a remedy and stops. Running `oss state_restore`
because replay failed is not your call to make silently: surface the line, name
the verb, let the user run it.

**Trigger phrases (description-match):**

- `/ossify:doctor [surface]` (slash command — see §12 for the `$ARGUMENTS` bridge)
- "run doctor", "check project health", "is my state healthy", "what's wrong
  with this project"
- "validate the spec", "check my MASTER-SPEC"
- "add a project rule", "author a machine-checkable rule"
- "check Codex interop", "can I switch between Claude and Codex here"
- "find orphan worktrees"
- "check the skill budget"
- "check plugin provenance", "which oss version is loaded"

**Do NOT auto-invoke when:**

- The user wants to **run a gate** — the work-item gate, the cumulative demo, a
  release's blocking findings. Those are `/close`, and they halt; you do not.
- The user wants to **author or amend the spec itself**. Fresh authoring is
  `/start`, which refuses on a declared repo that already carries code; a
  project that already has code adopts via `/ossify:adopt`. Amending an
  existing spec
  is not this surface's job — you validate what exists and never edit it.
- The user wants to **plan, decompose, or execute** anything. Those are
  `/plan-release`, `/plan-spine`, `/work-item`.
- The user asks to **fix** a finding you reported. Name the verb and let them
  run it, unless it is one of the two explicit-write surfaces above.
- The spec and the state disagree on **what adoption did**. Read
  `<ai-workspace>/ADOPTION.md` if it exists — it is adoption's record
  (`adopt` §6); route the discrepancy there before re-deriving one side.

---

## 2. Routing

`doctor` routes on **what the user asked for**, not on state. With no surface
named, run the full sweep (§3) — that is the common case and the default for a
bare `/ossify:doctor`.

```bash
surface="<the surface token from $ARGUMENTS, lowercased; empty if none>"
```

| `surface` | Go to |
|---|---|
| *(empty)* | §3 — the full sweep |
| `state`, `health` | §4 |
| `spec` | §5 |
| `rules`, `rule` | §6 |
| `interop`, `codex` | §7 |
| `budget` | §8 |
| `provenance` | §13 |

**An unrecognised token runs the full sweep anyway**, prefaced by one line
naming what was passed and listing the six surfaces. It does **not** refuse:
a user who mistypes a surface name still wants to know whether their project is
healthy, and this is the one skill whose whole contract is that it answers.

---

## 3. The full sweep

Run all six surfaces in the order of §4 → §8 then §13, and **report every one of them.**

**No check halts another.** This is the sharpest difference between `doctor` and
`close`, and copying `close`'s halt discipline here is the mistake to avoid: a
close halts because every later step *mutates* on the assumption the earlier one
passed. Nothing here mutates, so a failed check costs nothing but its own line.
An operator with a corrupt state file still needs to know their interop is also
broken — telling them one problem at a time is how a two-hour repair becomes
three sessions.

The corollary: **a surface that cannot run still emits a line.** `oss doctor`
already models this internally with `skip:` (see §4). Do the same at skill level
— "spec validation: skipped, no MASTER-SPEC.md at the manifest-routed path" is a
result. Silence is indistinguishable from a pass, and this skill exists to make
that confusion impossible.

**In a sweep, §6 runs read-only.** A bare `/ossify:doctor` carries no rule to author,
so the sweep's rule verdict is an *inspection*: how many `mcrule` blocks
`03-code-patterns.md` holds, whether each is well-formed, and whether any carry
a type this build does not recognise. It never prompts for a rule and never
writes. Authoring (§6's interactive flow) runs **only** on an explicit request
for a rule — otherwise the sweep would have to either stall soliciting an
unrelated write, or drop one of its six verdicts, and both break a contract
stated three paragraphs above this one.

Close with the read-out in §14.

---

## 4. State inspection

**Four checks are the verb's; the other five are yours.**

```bash
oss doctor
```

runs `state`, `schema`, `replay`, `shape`, tagged `ok:` / `fail:` / `skip:`, and
returns **rc 0 unless a `fail:` line was printed**. A healthy run prints **three**
lines: `state` has only a failure arm, because a missing file makes every later
check moot. Read the tags, not the line count. Those
four stayed deterministic because `close`'s pre-flight refuses to run until
`schema` and `replay` are green, and replay rebuilds the state from its base
snapshot to prove it: a rail in front of a mutation, not a read-out.

**Then you read the rest yourself** — `lock`, `ledger` (pending amendments,
quarantined lines), `fakes`, `patches`, and `worktrees`. They were ~210 lines of
bash that opened files and counted; they gated nothing, since every one emitted
`warn:` or `skip:` and neither ever touches the rc. Use the same line grammar, and
**say plainly at the end whether anything failed** — your half has no exit code.

`references/state-inspection.md` carries the exact reads, the counts, and the one
trap worth naming here: `jq`'s `length` works on strings too, so a corrupt field
returns a plausible number at rc 0. Ask for the field's `type` before trusting a
count.

**`worktrees` is the only one that reads the *repo* rather than the state file.**
It reports directories under `<repo>/.worktrees/` that no work item claims — why
that matters at all (spine close removes worktrees by reading state) is
`references/state-inspection.md` §4's account. Being repo-reading also makes
it the only one that can be legitimately *unavailable*: with no topology
declaration resolving — neither `.ossify/topology.json` nor a
`.workspace/pairing.json` on the walk-up path — there is no repo root to look
in, so emit `skip:` rather than falling silent.

**Print one line per repository**, tagged `worktrees(<repo-key>)` — the keys are
every repo the manifest declares, plus `ai_workspace`, resolved from the
manifest at run time rather than trusted from a list written here. A key the manifest
does not configure, or whose root is not on this machine, still costs a `skip:`
line. Do not summarise the lines into one verdict; the whole point is that
"clean" and "not looked at" stay distinguishable per repo (the #156 history that
made this literal is in `references/state-inspection.md` §4).

Two gates sit *before* the per-key loop — red state health, and a state this
directory's manifest does not route to — and each emits a single **unkeyed**
`skip: worktrees` line, because the cause is the run rather than any one repo.
An unkeyed line means the surface did not run at all, and it names why.

`oss worktree_orphans <repo-key> <state>` names the directories individually.
**Pass both arguments, every time.** doctor used to print this line for you with
both pinned; it does not any more, so the discipline is yours. Omitting the
key resolves to the sole declared repo under one, and refuses outright —
naming the declared set — under more than one (#272/#310 Task 4); relying on
that default is still the #156 habit, because a project that grows a second
repo turns every omitted call into a refusal instead of the per-repo
read-out this section exists to produce. Omitting the state lets an exported
`$OSS_STATE_FILE` answer about a different project.
Pin it once with `sf="${OSS_STATE_FILE:-$(oss state_path)}"` — **override first**,
matching what `oss doctor` itself resolves — and pass `"$sf"` to every read,
including to `oss doctor`. `references/state-inspection.md` §2 carries the
measurement, and the why-override-first account with it.
**It is a pure selector: the finding is its OUTPUT, and rc 0 means the check ran,
not that the tree is clean.** Branch on the rc and you will report every project
as orphan-free.

Full detail — the four-line remedy table and why you echo doctor's own line
rather than substituting a fixed remedy, the advisory-vs-blocking split, the
state-vs-repo drift checks that `oss doctor` cannot make mechanically, the
orphan-worktree remedy, and the feature map's inspection surface — is in
**`references/state-inspection.md`**.

---

## 5. Lean-spec validation

ossify's spec is the **lean** schema (spec §13.2), not the legacy 10-phase
MASTER-SPEC. The difference is the whole point: no FR/NFR ID tables are
required, and their absence is **not** an error.

Three rules carry the weight, and each fails in a way a reader would not guess:

1. **Sections 1–7 are the required set.** Legacy phase-named sections are not
   required and their presence is not an error either.
2. **The bones index must have a row per registry entry in
   `project-state.json`.** A registry entry with no index row is spec-vs-state
   drift — a `doctor` finding, and the reason this check belongs here rather
   than in `/start`.
3. **The posture section must be present and non-empty.** An *absent* posture is
   an error rather than a default, because absence is exactly the ambiguity the
   companion spec requires to resolve private.

Full detail — the section contract, the drift check's direction, the error
format with its line number and remediation hint, and what validation
deliberately does not check — is in **`references/spec-validation.md`**.

---

## 6. Machine-checkable rule authoring

`03-code-patterns.md` ships from `/start` with an **empty**
`## Machine-checkable rules` section — the heading present, no rules. Filling it
is this surface's job, and it is the one place `doctor` writes on purpose.

Four rule types, and the field sets are per-type rather than shared — the
reference's §3 table is the authoritative list; there is no verb behind it.

Validate every block **before** appending it — by reading it against that
table and the grammar (the reference's §5 checks, in their stated order). A
failing check names the one wrong line, never just "invalid block". **Shape
only**, and a rule body never enters a shell command: values are regexes full
of `$`, backticks and parentheses, and in a sweep they come out of a
repository file nobody here wrote.

Ossify evaluates no rule against a codebase mechanically, and never will —
**the evaluator is wontfix, settled 2026-08-15**: the work-item gate's Layer 3
agent read is ossify's evaluation mechanism. Tell the user that: a rule
authored today is documented, validated, and read by that gate at every
close — "read", not "applied": a rule whose check needs a measurement the
staged diff does not carry (`coverage_floor`'s threshold) is consulted, not
measured, there. (That statement speaks for ossify; what a mid-migration
project's legacy stack does with the shared artifact is that stack's own
contract — the reference's §2 has the boundary.)

**In a full sweep this surface is READ-ONLY** (§3). Authoring runs only on an
explicit rule request.

Full detail — the HTML-sentinel grammar and why fenced blocks were rejected, a
worked example per type, the per-type field table, the interactive authoring
flow, the idempotent append semantics, and the manifest-routed output path — is
in **`references/rule-authoring.md`**.

---

## 7. Workspace interop

Absorbed from `scaffold-onboard`'s `checking-workspace-interoperability` (spec
§8.1) so the unified plugin owns it and `workspace-init` stays unchanged. The
question it answers: **can this workspace be driven by Claude Code and by Codex,
interchangeably, mid-project?**

**You perform this one by reading. There is no dispatcher verb for it** — the
`interop_check` subcommand was removed. It was 175 lines of bash that opened
files and described what it found, which is work you do directly. Path
*resolution* stays deterministic (`oss repo_root`, `oss state_path`), because
every mutating verb routes through it.

Emit the same line grammar as `oss doctor` — `ok:` / `fail:` per check — and,
since there is no exit code now, **state plainly at the end whether anything
failed**. Checks, in order: the resolved topology declaration —
`.ossify/topology.json` first, `.workspace/pairing.json` as the translated
fallback, and that whichever resolves is *exactly one* JSON object — the
`ai_workspace` root and every declared repo's root
resolving to real directories, with each declared repo — never
`ai_workspace`, which is legitimately allowed to be untracked — also being a
git **work tree** (a bare repository or a `.git` directory is not
one and fails), the state path resolving and not silently
overridden, and **`AGENTS.md` existing and naming ossify**. That last one is the
check that is actually about Codex: `AGENTS.md` is the only file Codex reads for
project instructions, so a workspace whose `AGENTS.md` never mentions ossify has
a Codex session driving the project with none of its ceremonies.

**What was absorbed is the question, not the checklist.** The scaffold-onboard
original requires `routing.roadmap`, `routing.sprint_specs` and
`.workspace/locks` — every one of which this stack **retired**. Carrying that key
set over would report a correctly-configured ossify project as broken for
lacking the previous stack's furniture.

**Check only.** Spec §9.1 allocates `doctor` an *interop check*; the additive
repair half was scaffold-onboard's own extension and does not ship here (§9).
Report the failing line and name the fix; do not edit `AGENTS.md` yourself.

Full detail — each check with what it protects, why an unrouted manifest is
deliberately not a finding, and the remedy per failing line — is in
**`references/interop-check.md`**.

---

## 8. Budget check

The progressive-disclosure design targets **0.3–0.4% of a 200k context window**
for the front-loaded entry-skill surface (spec §64). That number is a claim, and
this surface is where it gets measured against the real installed plugin rather
than against the design document.

Two distinct budgets, and conflating them is a documented, repeated error in
this project's own history:

| Budget | What it sums | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| **Every-call description** | the `description:` frontmatter of `commands/*.md` — what the listing loads (#263) | `check 7`, a red test |
| **SKILL.md body** | line count per `SKILL.md`, 500 each | `check 6`, a red test |

Neither is affected by `references/`, by `plugin.json`'s description, or by the
agent listing — those are *different budgets*, and trimming one to relieve
another frees exactly nothing. Before claiming any edit buys room, read the
check that enforces the budget you mean.

Full detail — both budgets with their live headroom, the third (agent-listing)
budget that nothing enforces, how to verify the whole-session figure against
Claude Code's own `/doctor`, and the measurement trap that has now produced the
same wrong claim in three documents — is in **`references/budget-check.md`**.

---

## 9. What `doctor` deliberately does not do

Named here rather than left to read as executed:

- **Migration.** Spec §9.1 allocates `doctor` the `migrate` entry point in
  **phase 2**. `oss migrate` exists and moves a state file's schema version;
  the artifact-converting `migrate` *flow* does not ship in this release.
- **Rule evaluation.** §6 authors and validates rule blocks. Running them
  against a codebase mechanically is **wontfix** (settled 2026-08-15): the
  work-item gate's Layer 3 agent read is ossify's evaluation mechanism, and
  no ossify evaluator will ship.
- **Interop repair.** §7 checks; it does not add manifest keys or merge
  `AGENTS.md`. Spec §9.1 says *check*, and the repair half belongs to
  `scaffold-onboard`'s original — porting it would also mean porting a managed
  `AGENTS.md` section this stack does not yet define.
- **Vocabulary maintenance.** A term drifting is a domain-model finding, not
  a state defect — the discipline is `start`'s `references/domain-modeling.md`,
  exercised through the bone retro's lessons section and its own stumble
  trigger; nothing here scans for it.
- **Gates.** Nothing here blocks anything. `close` owns every blocking gate,
  and a `fail:` line from `doctor` is information for the operator, not a veto
  this skill enforces.
- **Repairs you were not asked for.** §1.

---

## 10. Anti-patterns (do not do these)

- **Refusing because the project is broken.** That is the finding, not an
  obstacle to reporting it (§1).
- **Halting the sweep on the first `fail:`.** Nothing here mutates, so nothing
  downstream is unsafe. Report all six surfaces (§3).
- **Letting a surface that could not run print nothing.** Silence reads as a
  pass (§3).
- **Branching on `oss worktree_orphans`' rc.** rc 0 means it ran. The finding is
  the output (§4).
- **Echoing `oss worktree_orphans canonical` when the warn line named a
  different repo.** The verb takes a repo key. The wrong one sends the operator
  to search a repository that has nothing wrong with it, and they come back
  believing doctor was mistaken (§4).
- **Collapsing the per-repo `worktrees(...)` lines into one verdict.** Their
  separateness *is* the finding: one repo clean and another unconfigured is not
  the same state as both clean (§4).
- **Copying `oss touch_check`'s rc polarity onto anything here.** rc 0 is a
  *hit* there. Nothing on this skill's surface shares that convention.
- **Substituting a fixed remedy for `oss doctor`'s own line.** The remedy
  differs by which line failed, and naming `state_restore` for a schema failure
  loops the operator forever (§4).
- **Running `oss state_restore`, `oss migrate`, or any repair verb on your own
  initiative.** Name it; let the user run it (§1).
- **Treating a missing FR/NFR table as a spec error.** The lean schema does not
  require one (§5).
- **Appending a rule block without validating it first**, or inventing a field
  name a type does not define (§6).
- **Telling the user an authored rule is mechanically enforced.** It is
  documented, well-formed, and read by the work-item gate's agent — the
  evaluator is wontfix (§6, §9).
- **Editing `AGENTS.md` or the pairing manifest to make the interop check
  pass.** This surface checks; the user repairs (§7, §9).
- **Demanding `routing.roadmap`, `routing.sprint_specs` or `.workspace/locks`.**
  Those belong to the stack ossify replaced, and a project that lacks them is
  correct, not broken (§7).
- **Claiming an edit freed budget without reading the check that enforces
  it** (§8).
- **Editing a `description:` to make room and not re-measuring.** `check 7` is
  a red test; a description edit that overruns fails the suite (§8).
- **Letting this body exceed 500 lines.** Hard cap; depth goes to `references/`.

---

## 11. Notes on tool boundaries

- **You** (Claude reading this body) make every judgment: whether a `warn:` is
  worth acting on now, whether a drift is the record's fault or the repo's,
  whether a proposed rule is the right rule, whether an interop gap matters for
  this project.
- **`oss`** handles mechanical facts only and holds no judgment: `doctor` (the
  check lines and their rc), `worktree_orphans` (the on-disk-minus-state
  difference — never whether an orphan is safe to delete),
  `state_path`, `repo_root`, `manifest_require`, `get` (arbitrary reads),
  `feature_list`, `critic_detect`, `state_restore` and `migrate` (**named to the
  user, not run by you**).
- **`git`** is reached only as `git -C "<absolute path>"`. Resolve paths once
  with `oss state_path` / `oss repo_root <key>` and never `cd`: the manifest walk
  starts at `$PWD`, so a `cd` mid-run silently re-points the state file rather
  than failing.
- **Peer entry skills:** `start` owns spec-core authoring and the bones registry;
  `plan-release` owns spine selection and the class declaration; `plan-spine`
  owns decomposition and demo lines; `work-item` owns execution; `close` owns
  every gate and every ceremony.
- **The user** decides what to act on. You report, rank, and name the verb.

---

## 12. Slash-command interaction

`/ossify:doctor [surface]` (`commands/doctor.md`) exports the raw argument string as
`$ARGUMENTS` through an env-var bridge. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS` in bash; never
reference `$1` / `$2` / `$N`** — Claude Code substitutes positional tokens in
command bodies at template-render time and silently corrupts them.

The only argument is an optional surface name (§2). Absent or unrecognised, run
the full sweep.

---

## 13. Plugin provenance

Run this surface in every full sweep and directly for `provenance`. Report
three roles separately — **answering binary**, **loaded doctor body**,
**expected reference** — each resolved role with its concrete path and
manifest version, never one substituted for another. All three resolved and
both active versions equal to expected is `ok`; either differing is `warn`;
any unresolved role is `partial`, with a resolved binary/body disagreement
preserved inside the partial. Detection compares versions only; never derive
a version from a cache-directory name.

Any version disagreement between resolved roles — including binary/body
disagreement while expected is unresolved — triggers prior-use inspection:
name prior `oss` verbs and compare only concrete ossify prose loaded before
this invocation. Impact coverage that could not be completed is `incomplete`
and never changes the surface verdict. Never scan unused skills, reverse-map
verbs, or decide reruns. Follow `references/provenance-check.md`; report
without updating or halting anything.

## 14. The doctor read-out

**The read-out is this skill's final assistant message.** It is a message, not a
file: `doctor` writes no report artifact.

It carries, in this order:

1. **Each surface with its verdict** — including the ones that were skipped, and
   why. The six lines are roll-ups: each is followed by that surface's own
   tagged lines verbatim. A `skip:` inside a surface never rolls up to `ok:` —
   the roll-up says `partial` and names which check did not run — and the
   `worktrees(<key>)` lines are never merged.
2. **Findings, worst first**, each with the remedy verb named literally. A
   `fail:` outranks a `warn:`; a `warn:` that blocks a close outranks one that
   does not.
3. **What is advisory** — stated as advisory, so a `warn:` is not read as a
   thing that must be fixed before work continues.
4. **What the operator must do next**, if anything — or an explicit "nothing"
   rather than trailing off, so a clean project reads as clean rather than as a
   run that stopped early.
