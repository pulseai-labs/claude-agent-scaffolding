# Class declaration (bone / flesh / internal-enabler)

Depth for SKILL.md §7a. **Class is the only classification.** There is no size
axis, no weight axis, no "small bone" — a spine's class answers one question:
*does this spine move a bone?*

| Class | Definition | Ceremony |
|---|---|---|
| **bone** | Creates or modifies a bone — the skeleton itself, a new boundary, a new cross-cutting contract, a data-ownership change, a stack decision | Full: grill gates at planning, full close-depth audit with the external adversary when one is configured, full retro, ADR required |
| **flesh** | Lands entirely on existing bones — features, deepening passes, polish | Core rows only, plus a light host-only critic pass that includes a mandatory bone-touch check |
| **internal-enabler** | Not a user-facing spine at all: no actor-to-outcome journey. Rare, and admission-gated | See §4 — it is a *verdict*, and admission is a separate judgment |

Core rows (impl-check, cumulative demo, memory-bank harvest, handoff/state,
worktree cleanup) are **never skippable in either class**. Class controls the
rows *above* the core, not whether the core runs.

## 1. The ladder (run in this order)

Order matters, and it decides two separate things. **An earlier rung's verdict
is never overridden by a later one** — once a rung sets the class, no later rung
changes it. **Every rung still runs anyway**, because the later rungs carry
obligations of their own that an earlier verdict does not discharge — rung 3 is
the only source of the new-bone obligation, and skipping it is how the registry
rots. The one exception is rung 1: an `internal-enabler` verdict stops the
ladder outright, and its own text says so.

### Rung 1 — the journey gate

> **Does this spine deliver an actor-to-outcome journey?** A named actor performs
> an action and reaches an observable outcome they came for.

If **no** — the spine only builds an architectural layer, and its stated evidence
of completion is that an *artifact exists* ("the migration runs and the tables
exist", "the module compiles", "the endpoint returns 200") rather than an actor
reaching an outcome — it is an **`internal-enabler`**. It is **never** accepted as
a user-facing `flesh` or `bone` spine, no matter how much architecture it moves or
how obviously it will be needed. Stop the ladder and go to §4.

This is the mechanical anti-foundation-phase rule. "The UI will consume it
someday" no longer qualifies as product value.

**Do not over-trip this gate.** It fires on *positive evidence of a missing
journey* — an artifact-existence demo, or a plan that names no actor at all — not
on the mere presence of architecture. A spine that introduces a load-bearing
architecture **and** carries the journey that exercises it is a **bone spine**,
not an enabler. Introducing a bone is not by itself horizontal; §3's contrast
table is the discriminator.

**The actor does not have to be human.** Spec §3: a headless product — a library,
a database, a service — "defines its journey at its real surface, e.g. a
downstream API round trip, and no UI is invented." For a headless product the
actor *is* the consumer of its interface, and a spine that carries a real round
trip through that interface passes rung 1.

The ban is on **artifact-existence**, not on non-human actors. Read the anti-
example above precisely: "the endpoint returns 200" fails because a status code
is not an outcome anyone came for — **not** because an API is involved. The same
endpoint, exercised as *"a downstream service submits an order through the client
and gets back a confirmed order id"*, is a journey.

| Spine | Rung 1 |
|---|---|
| "the migration runs and the tables exist" | ✗ artifact existence |
| "the endpoint returns 200" | ✗ a status code is not an outcome |
| "the module compiles" | ✗ artifact existence |
| **"a downstream service queries the store through the client SDK and gets results ranked by recency"** | **✓ a consumer reaches an outcome through the real surface** |

Getting this wrong on a headless project mis-trips `internal-enabler` on **every
legitimate spine**, because every one of them lands at an API rather than a
screen — and an internal-enabler cannot claim product value, so the whole product
becomes unable to demonstrate any. `plan-spine/references/demo-authoring.md`
§3.2b states the same rule for demo lines; the two must agree.

### Rung 2 — the bone-touch judge (mechanical)

> **Does the spine's plan touch a registered bone or risk-gate surface?**

`oss touch_check <paths…>` — rc 0 means matched. A hit → **`bone`**, regardless of
the declared class, regardless of the critic. rc 2 means the judge could not run
(no paths, or an unreadable state) and is **not** a clean verdict — fix the state
before declaring. Full usage in `references/bone-touch-judge.md`.

### Rung 3 — bone by creation

> **Does the spine create or modify a load-bearing, hard-to-reverse decision?**

The bones vocabulary, verbatim from the forced-enumeration checklist: system
shape & deployment topology · module boundaries & dependency direction · data
ownership & migration posture · public contracts & compatibility policy · trust
boundaries & destructive operations · failure visibility · rollback & evolution
strategy · stack · cross-cutting constraints.

Yes → **`bone`**, and the spine owes an **ADR** (authored `Proposed`, flipped to
`Accepted` once the release exercises it) with a declared touch surface — which
is what makes the *next* spine's rung-2 check work. A new bone with no registered
surface is how the registry rots.

Rung 3 catches what rung 2 cannot: a spine that creates a bone in files nobody has
registered yet, because the bone does not exist until this spine lands.

**One category carries an admission bar, not just a label: `system shape &
deployment topology`.** Classifying a service extraction `bone` says how much
ceremony it gets, not whether it is allowed — so a spine that moves existing
work into a second deployable can pass this ladder and be selected on nothing
but intent. It is admitted only on **measured pressure**: evidence that this
seam specifically needs independent deployment, scaling, security isolation,
failure containment, or separate ownership. An anticipated pressure is not
evidence, and the ADR records the evidence as the decision's grounds. The full
bar, and the deferral path when the evidence is absent, is
`plan-spine/references/codebase-design.md` §3 — and **this rung is where it
binds**, because this runs at release planning and that file loads later, at
spine decomposition, when the release has already committed to the spine.

Record the evidence in the rationale, not only in the ADR: for this case §2's
string takes a trailing `; pressure: <the measured evidence>`. Without it a
declarer who follows §2 records a reason indistinguishable from a speculative
split's, which is the gap the ADR was supposed to close.

### Rung 4 — otherwise, flesh

Entirely on existing bones. **Do not inflate it.** Bone ceremony on a genuine
flesh spine is not "being careful" — it is ceremony inflation, it costs real
hours per spine, and it trains people to skip checklists wholesale. If rungs 1-3
found nothing, the answer is `flesh` and the reason is *"lands entirely on
existing bones: <which ones it uses>"*.

Then the critic veto (`references/critic-veto.md`) may push `flesh → bone`. It
never pushes `bone → flesh`; only an explicit, recorded user override does that.

---

## 2. Stating the rationale

Every declaration carries a one-line reason naming **the rule that decided it**.
The reason is written into state (`oss class_set`'s 3rd argument, or the spine's
line in `RELEASE.md`) and read back at close.

| Rule | Reason shape |
|---|---|
| Journey gate | `internal-enabler: no actor-to-outcome journey (demo is "<artifact exists>")` |
| Bone-touch | `bone-touch: ADR-0002 (src/domain/**)` |
| Bone by creation | `creates a bone: <category> — <decision>; ADR-00NN` |
| Flesh | `lands entirely on existing bones (<bones used>); no registered surface touched` |
| Enabler admission | `internal-enabler admitted: consumed by <spine-id> in <release-id>` |

"It felt architectural" is not a rationale. Name the rung.

---

## 3. Worked contrasts

The four archetypes, including the three recorded historical failure modes.

| Spine as proposed | Rung that fires | Class | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Build the persistence layer" — schema + repository + migrations, declared as a user-facing flesh spine; its demo is *"the migration runs and the tables exist"* | 1 | **internal-enabler** | Artifact-existence demo, no actor and no outcome. A horizontal build wearing a spine costume — the failure mode the methodology exists to prevent |
| "Add a second order type", declared `flesh`; plan changes `src/domain/port.rs`, listed in the hexagonal-core bone's touch surface | 2 | **bone** | The declared class is a claim; the touch surface is a fact. Facts win |
| "Add a CSV export button" — uses the existing report port and UI shell, touches no registered surface, delivers "a user exports a report and opens the file" | 4 | **flesh** | Genuine flesh. Do not inflate it because "export sounds like a contract" — nothing registered says it is |
| "Introduce the event-sourcing persistence model" — new load-bearing, hard-to-reverse persistence architecture, with an ADR and a declared touch surface | 3 | **bone** | Creates a bone. It carries the journey that exercises it, so rung 1 does **not** fire; the presence of architecture is not the enabler test |

The last two rows are the ones people get wrong in opposite directions: inflating
flesh out of caution, and demoting a real bone spine to "internal" because it
sounds infrastructural.

## 4. `internal-enabler`: verdict first, admission second

These are **two distinct judgments**, and conflating them is how the
anti-foundation-phase rule gets defeated. The verdict is reported as
`internal-enabler` either way — admission decides whether it enters the release,
not what it is.

**Judgment 1 — the class verdict** (rung 1): the spine has no actor-to-outcome
journey → it is an `internal-enabler`. Done. This verdict does not depend on
whether anything consumes it, and it is the answer to "what class is this spine?"
whatever judgment 2 concludes.

**Judgment 2 — admission** (spec §5.3): an internal-enabler is admitted into the
release **only if** it names the **committed user-facing spine that consumes it**,
scheduled in the **current or next release** — the one-release-ahead cap.

- Named consumer, scheduled in range → **admitted**. It must be declared as
  internal at release planning (not discovered later), it may contribute `auto:`
  demo lines only — never a `user:` journey line — and it **cannot claim product
  value** in the release's exit criteria.
- No named consumer, or the consumer is three releases out, or the consumer is
  "the UI, eventually" → **not admitted**. **Silence is not a named consumer:**
  if the plan in front of you does not name one, the answer is not-admitted — do
  not assume a consumer exists because one plausibly could. If §5c already
  minted it, retire the spine first: `oss spine_status "<sid>" abandoned` —
  there is no delete verb, and a spine left `planned` either appears in
  `spine_dag` as work nobody will do or is omitted from it, which
  `spine-sequencing-dag.md` §3 reads as *missing from the plan*. It returns to the
  feature map:

  ```bash
  oss feature_add "<name>" "<the value it would enable>" bone feature-map-return
  ```

- If the consuming spine is later **dropped**, the internal spine returns to the
  feature map too. The dependency runs both ways.

Admission is scored separately from class — `plan-spine` enforces the consumer
rule along with the demo-line floors. Do not merge them into one verdict.

---

## 5. Recording an admitted enabler

**This section applies only once judgment 2 has *admitted* the enabler.** A
non-admitted enabler never gets a spine id at all — it goes back to the feature
map (§4), and the verdict you report is `internal-enabler`, full stop.

`oss spine_add` and `oss class_set` validate their class argument against
`bone|flesh` and **exit 2** on anything else. `internal-enabler` is a planning
verdict, not a state value — do not try to write it as a class.

An **admitted** internal-enabler is therefore recorded under its structural class
— run rungs 2-4 on it to find out which — with its enabler status carried in the
spine's name and its RELEASE.md line:

```bash
sid="$(oss spine_add "$rel" "[internal] event-store schema" bone)"
oss class_set "$sid" bone "internal-enabler admitted: consumed by r1.s4 (MVP); creates a bone (data ownership)"
```

The `[internal]` marker and the reason string are what `plan-spine` reads to
enforce "`auto:` lines only". A **non-admitted** enabler is never given a spine id
at all — it goes back to the feature map (§4).

---

## 6. Release 0

The **skeleton spine** is `bone` by definition: it creates the skeleton, which is
the first bone. It passes rung 1 trivially (the skeleton cut *is* an
actor-to-outcome journey — that is what the cut question asks for) and is
declared `bone` without deliberation.

If Release 0 contains a second spine, run the full ladder on it like any other. A
Release 0 whose *only* spine is an internal-enabler is a failed skeleton cut, not
a plan — send it back to `start`'s cut question.

---

## 7. Anti-patterns

- **Accepting a horizontal build as a spine** because it is "obviously needed
  next". Rung 1 exists for exactly this.
- **Merging the enabler verdict with the admission decision.** Two judgments.
- **Admitting an enabler on "the UI will consume it someday".** Name the spine and
  the release, or it goes back to the map.
- **Inflating a flesh spine to bone out of caution.** Ceremony inflation trains
  people to skip checklists.
- **Demoting a bone spine to `flesh` because it is small.** Class is not size.
  A one-file change that moves a boundary is a bone spine.
- **Declaring class from the feature map's `class_guess` without re-running the
  ladder.** The guess was made before the plan existed; the ladder reads the plan.
- **A new bone with no touch surface.** Then the next spine's rung 2 cannot see
  it, and the registry silently stops working.
- **Passing `internal-enabler` to `oss spine_add` / `oss class_set`.** Exit 2
  (§5).
