# Plain-repo adoption — class P (#536)

Depth for `SKILL.md` §3, §4, §5 and §6. `/adopt` takes two kinds of project that carry product source: **class L**, a
project onboarded with the scaffold-dev legacy stack (the path in `SKILL.md`, unchanged), and **class P**, a plain
existing-source repo with no such stack (this file). A project with no product source is class G or H and goes
to `/ossify:start`.

This file is prose on purpose (skill-first question 1: whether `HEAD` holds product, whether a step works and
which decision is real are judgments). The one mechanical part, the git probes, runs fixed arguments on closed
input (question 2).

---

## 1. The class step — after A1, before A2

The class needs the declared repos, so it runs once A1 has resolved or authored the topology. Same order and same
scope as `/start` §3's canonical-content gate: every declared repo except one the pairing manifest declares under
`tooling_repo` (#553; in a native `.ossify/topology.json` every key is checked). The AI workspace's own history is
never an input. `git -C <root> ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD` and `git -C <root> rev-list --count HEAD` only
propose: show what you found, and the operator confirms whether `HEAD` holds product (not docs, a dead prototype
or a bare scaffold). Ask in order; the first yes decides.

1. **Does any declared repo carry product source at `HEAD`?** No: refuse, authoring nothing further, and route to **`/ossify:start`**
   (class G, no history; class H, history only). The topology A1 may have just authored stays, uncommitted, and
   `/start` resolves it. A declared repo with no commit is not this answer: see the unborn-`HEAD` rule below.
2. **Yes, and the project has a scaffold-dev stack** (a roadmap state or an active-context cursor): **class L**.
   Look where A5 looks: the manifest-routed roadmap state (`well_known_paths.roadmap_state`) and memory bank's
   `05-active-context.md`; a native topology routes neither, so look at the conventional
   `<ai-workspace>/.workspace/project-roadmap.json` and `<ai-workspace>/.claude/memory-bank/05-active-context.md`.
   `SKILL.md` as written. Every declared repo goes through L's path in one run.
3. **Yes, and no stack: class P.** A partial stack (legacy files, but neither a roadmap state nor a cursor) is
   P; the adoption record names the legacy files seen.

L and P never mix: the stack's roadmap state and cursor live in the AI workspace, so the stack is project-wide. A
repo the stack never covered is a C2 gap under L, not a second adoption.

A declared repo with no commit has no baseline SHA. If it holds files, stop and name it before anything is recorded:
the operator commits them first (that is not "no product source", and it does not route to `/start`). A repo with
no files at all is left out of the declaration.

Record `Class: P` (or `L`) in the adoption record.

## 2. A1 on class P — two routes

Class P runs in an **AI workspace the operator made**: an empty directory beside the product repo, `git init`,
with `/adopt` started from it. Adoption never makes a product repo its own AI workspace, and
never writes a byte in a product repo during A1.
**Check first** that the working directory is not a declared repo and is not inside one
(compare `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` with each declared or operator-named root). If it is, refuse
before authoring anything, and name the fix: make an AI workspace beside the product repo and run `/adopt` there.

- **No topology on the walk-up path:** ask which repos hold the product, confirm each root against a checkout that
  carries its code, and author `.ossify/topology.json` with each (A1's nothing-found authoring, schema and name
  rules as `/start` §3 states them).
- **A topology already resolves** (a `/pair-workspace` workspace): use it, and ask which repos hold the product.
  A product repo the declaration does not name refuses, and the refusal names the fix in the declaration's own spelling.
  A native `.ossify/topology.json` takes `.repos.<key>.root` (`lib/manifest.sh` reads only `.repos` there); a
  `.workspace/pairing.json` pairing manifest takes a top-level `{"root": "<absolute path>"}` entry under a fresh key
  (`[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*`), which the pairing shape reads as a repo. adopt does not edit a declaration it did not write.

The plain route does not need `/pair-workspace`, which declares one canonical and aborts when that repo holds a
memory bank or `MASTER-SPEC.md`.

**A3's one exemption.** A1 commits the topology it authored only after the gates pass; until then it is untracked.
A3 exempts the exact path `.ossify/topology.json` in the AI workspace, and only when A1 authored it in this run.
On a re-run after a refusal the file is no longer "this run's": delete it (A1 re-authors it) or commit it.

## 3. A3, A4, A5 on class P

- **A3:** `git -C <root> status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` per declared repo and the AI workspace, so the
  exemption above is exact. Any other line refuses, as "work in flight" (the operator commits, finishes or drops
  it in the repo it touched), not as a legacy slice close. The default-branch rule is unchanged; an unborn `HEAD`
  stops (§1).
- **A4:** `git -C <root> worktree list --porcelain` per declared repo. Name each worktree besides the main one, and
  get the operator's confirmation that none holds work in flight. The `.worktrees` probe is class L's.
- **A5:** record `A5: no legacy stack` among the gates passed.
- **A6 — something ships.** Class P only, after A5 and before `oss init`. Ask the operator to name at least one
  journey step that works from a clean checkout today, and how they know (a command, or a run they watched).
  None: refuse, before any state is written:

  > nothing ships yet: this project is pre-skeleton. ossify cannot onboard it until one step works, or until the
  > operator decides the code is a prototype and archives it.

  A6 asks; C2 verifies. The topology A1 authored stays uncommitted on a refusal here (§2: delete it to retry).

Once A0 to A6 have passed, commit the authored topology (the baseline SHAs and `oss init` come after).

## 4. C1, C2 and C4 on class P

C1 and C2 are as `SKILL.md` has them. With no legacy roadmap, read the plan the repo carries (a roadmap, a
planning doc, its spec), then elicit the steps with the operator as `/start` §5 does and mark each against the
checkout.

**C4 closes Release 0 only when at least one step is still `shipped` after C2**, in any repo. A step that fails its
clean-checkout test is already re-marked `next` (C2), and harvested to the feature map then (C1's harvest ran
before C2), or the completion floor refuses. The release description drops `under <legacy-stack>`.

**Zero steps left `shipped`** (a stated known limit): at C4, after C3, do not call `release_add`. Write the adoption
record to that point (class, gates, baseline table, the C1 table, every C2 result and gap), then halt. The hand-off
names what to clear to retry: the file `oss state_path` prints and its `.base.json` sibling, `ADOPTION.md` moved
aside (C5 creates it only when absent), and C3's uncommitted ADR files in the product repo (commit or remove
them: A3 refuses them on retry). It says what happened: A6 asked, C2 found the checkout disagrees. The
completion floor does not apply to this halt: it is a halt with its record written, not a completion.

## 5. C5 on class P

- **`AGENTS.md`:** a workspace-init stub (first line `<!-- workspace-init stub: ossify:start replaces this file
  -->`) is replaced, not merged, per `../../start/references/occupied-destinations.md` §1a, carrying its
  `## Git policy` and `## AI-trace filter` sections verbatim; the hand-off says so. Any other `AGENTS.md` merges
  as `SKILL.md` says. (Class L benefits too: before this, adopt merged into the stub and kept its marker line.)
- **Files inside a declared repo are inputs only:** its `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, a spec or design
  doc, a memory bank. Read them for Vision, C1 and the memory-bank harvest. Never write, move or delete one. The
  adoption record lists each one read and each conflict with the AI workspace's `AGENTS.md`; the operator decides
  what to retire. (The `docs/adr/` and `PUBLIC_BOUNDARY.md` rows of C5's table are the only writes into a declared
  repo.)
- `MASTER-SPEC.md`, the memory bank and the other AI-workspace rows: authored where absent, per C5's table.

## 6. Other stations that differ

- **Vision:** elicited as `/start` §4 does, after reading the README and §5's inputs. Class L still confirms.
- **Smoke:** class P with no test suite runs `/start` §9 in full. A repo with one keeps the narrowed smoke.
- **C3:** a repo with no `docs/adr/` gets the forced-enumeration questions as today. An answer that names a real
  decision gets an ADR from `bones-registry.md` §3's mint scan with `dest_repo` set to that repo, minted
  `Accepted`. These files land after the baseline SHA and stay **uncommitted** in the product repo; the hand-off
  names them for the operator to commit.
- **Floor:** C2 may leave zero `shipped` steps (§4); that halt and C3's collision halt (`SKILL.md` C3 1a) are the
  outcomes besides completion.
