# The per-entry refusal, ONCE. A REAL entry carrying a surrounding invisible
# character is not blank - it passes the emptiness arm - and its glob can never
# match a real path once that character is part of it. Measured on 602565f: a
# CR-terminated glob was journaled at rc 0 and touch_check went CLEAN on the very
# path the re-point was meant to cover, which is the defect these verbs exist to
# repair entered through their own argument handling.
#
# The edge class is `[\s\p{Cf}]`, not `\s` alone. `\s` is Unicode White_Space and
# covers the CR, tab, VT, NBSP and ideographic-space vectors - but NOT the format
# characters, and a UTF-8 BOM (U+FEFF) or a zero-width space (U+200B) sits on
# line 1 of exactly the composed-from-a-Windows-file input this rail exists for.
# Measured before this extension: a BOM-prefixed and a ZWSP-suffixed glob were
# BOTH journaled at rc 0 and touch_check answered CLEAN on the covered path - the
# #530 harm one invisible character wide of the guard. `\p{Cf}` closes the family
# (BOM, ZWSP, ZWNJ, ZWJ, soft hyphen, bidi marks).
#
# LEADING/TRAILING only, deliberately: an interior space is legal (a path can
# contain one), so this is narrower than "any whitespace". The offending entry is
# named with @json, because a CR on a terminal is invisible and "trailing
# whitespace" alone does not say which entry to fix. @json renders `\r`, `\t` and
# `\v` in escaped form but passes NBSP, U+3000, BOM and ZWSP through as raw
# UTF-8, so for those vectors the named entry reads like a clean glob; that
# fidelity gap is tracked on #551, and the refusal itself is unaffected.
#
# It is shared with the two ADD verbs because the same entry can be journaled at
# MINT, where nothing refused it and there is no re-point to repair it with: a
# bone minted on a CRLF-composed csv declared a surface that touch_check then
# answered CLEAN on, from mint day, with rc 0 and nothing to review. The mint
# takes this arm and the one-list arm - it does NOT take the emptiness arm,

# #305 item 1: the add verbs refuse a ref that already exists. The ADR ref (and

# gate, the registry doc - and the writer did not enforce it: a second bone_add
# for ADR-013 minted a second row for one ref (the PulseDB adopt pilot,
# 2026-08-23), after which bone_set_touch refuses the ref at rc 7 and the
# operator holds a surface they cannot repair. Nothing DETECTS a duplicate
# (doctor's four checks are state/schema/replay/shape), so the writer is the only
# place the mint can be refused. risk_gate_add carries the same rail: the two are
# one defect class - the duplicate-row fixtures in test-registries.sh were already
# labelled "#305 shape" for both - and a duplicate gate name is refused by
# set_controls/set_touch with a message naming #305, so an open gate writer would

# same polarity as oss_verify_report_cross_check. A caller that copies the
# touch_check branch shape inverts the judge and closes exactly the releases it
# exists to block, so the ceremony's `case` arms are spelled out in
# skills/close/references/fake-expiry.md §2.
#
# Selector, both arms load-bearing:
#   * STATUS - `active` OR `renewed`. `replaced` is the ONLY resolving status
#     (the status enum in oss_reg_set_fake_status, below). Selecting on
#     `active` alone lets a renewal escape its
#     own deadline: someone already pushed that deadline once, which is what
#     makes the renewal the entry MOST in need of the check, and it would fail
#     silently green.
#   * EXPIRY - AT OR BEFORE this release, compared NUMERICALLY. Identity lets
#     every fake that outlived its deadline escape forever. A string compare is
#     wrong from r10 on: jq evaluates `"r2" <= "r10"` as false, so the `r` is
#     stripped and the remainder compared as a number.
#
# A record whose `expiry_release` cannot be parsed as `r<N>` BLOCKS, marked
# `unparseable-expiry`. It is not skipped: an expiry that never compares is an
# expiry that never fires, which is precisely "deferred truth becomes permanent
# silently". `try/catch` keeps the malformed value from aborting the whole
# selector, so one bad record cannot make every other fake escape with it.
#
# The release argument is validated for SHAPE only, never for existence: this is
# a read-only selector whose release id reaches it from `oss id_parse`, and an
# existence check would add an rc-7 arm the ceremony has no branch for.
