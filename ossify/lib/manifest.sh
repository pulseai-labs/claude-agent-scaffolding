# before any jq read. The closed enum this replaces was accidentally that
# boundary; this one is deliberate (#272 design section 3, adjacent to #120).
#
# The sets are ENUMERATED, not written as `[a-z]`. A bracket RANGE is
# collation-ordered outside the C locale, and every UTF-8 collation interleaves
# the cases - so `*[!a-z0-9_-]*` admitted `svcA` on the operator's macOS shell
# and refused it under CI's C locale. A boundary whose shape depends on $LANG is
# not a boundary. The leading-character arm is enumerated for the same reason,
# and it refuses a leading `-` or `_` as well as a leading digit: the grammar
# says the first character is a letter, and a key starting `-` is an argument to
# every command this name is interpolated into.

# One internal shape from either source (#272 design section 2). The pairing
# arm promotes EVERY top-level object carrying .root except ai_workspace to a
# repos entry - canonical, private_core, tooling_repo, and any role a future
# workspace-init invents - so the writer side can never again declare a role
# the reader refuses. Unknown keys ride along ignored (pulse-trader's extended
# routing keys require exactly this).
# The `.repos` map is a BOUNDARY, not a field with a default. `repos: (.repos //
# {})` normalized a null, absent or empty map to `{}` and returned rc 0, so
# `oss state_path` succeeded on a topology declaring nothing: /start read it as
# resolved, would neither author nor overwrite it, and the first defaulted repo
# operation failed with "[] are declared" far from the cause.
#
# `ai_workspace` is likewise refused HERE rather than at `_oss_repo_key_valid`.
# The validator guards the lookup side, and `_oss_repo_root` tests the reserved
# alias BEFORE it ever calls the validator - so a declared `.repos.ai_workspace`

# Dispatcher glue: resolve the state path for a subcommand.
# Precedence: explicit $1 > $OSS_STATE_FILE (test/override) > manifest-derived.
#
# The env branch names itself on STDERR when it is genuinely overriding a
# manifest-routed project: a stale OSS_STATE_FILE exported by an unrelated
# session silently redirects every read and every write, and nothing else in the
# output says where the path came from.
#
# Two boundaries are deliberate. The notice never goes to stdout — this
# function's stdout IS the state path, and callers consume it as a value. And it
# stays silent when there is no manifest, or when the manifest agrees: nothing is
# being overridden in either case, and a notice on every call is noise the reader
# learns to skip, which is the failure mode this is supposed to prevent.
#
# #171 SETTLED 2026-08-16: the rail stays BLUNT and now says so in its own text —
# the notice names raw-string comparison, so an equivalent spelling reads as the
# rail's known bluntness rather than as real divergence. The alternatives were each
# walked and declined: canonicalization is not coming back (deleted on PR #184 with
# its own do-not-restore note below — path normalization cost this repo four review
# rounds on PR #166 and seven findings across four more rounds on PR #182); `-ef`
# is read-identity and this function's result feeds
# mutating verbs (the exact -ef-on-a-write-target mistake PR #178 paid two P1s for);
# and a refuse-rather-than-warn redesign across all 42 callers would be new
# deterministic gating semantics, which the 2026-08-15 freeze declines. Removing the
# notice entirely was tried on PR #178 and reverted: it is a SAFETY RAIL, not a
# read-out, and docs/conventions/skill-first.md puts "safety rails the agent must
# not argue past" on the deterministic side.

# `_oss_canon_path` was DELETED here (PR #184), closing #151 and #168 without
# either being fixed. It canonicalized a path for identity comparison and had
# exactly two consumers: `oss_interop_check`, which became prose on PR #182, and
# `oss_cmd_doctor`'s repo-vs-state worktree check, which became prose here. With
# both gone it had no callers, so it left with them - function AND its ~21 direct
# test assertions in tests/test-manifest.sh, together.
#
# Do not bring it back. Path normalization has cost this repo four review rounds
# in the bash (PR #166) and seven findings across four more in the prose that
# briefly replaced it (PR #182), and both times the net product value was a path
# normalizer. If you need to compare two paths, prefer a blunt comparison that
# fails SAFE and says what to do about it; see doctor/references/interop-check.md.
