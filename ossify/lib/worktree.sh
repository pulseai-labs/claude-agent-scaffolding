# Orphan detection - the ONE real use of the enumeration verb v0.2 retired (see
# the `oss_cmd_worktree_list` tombstone in lib/commands.sh, which named this
# requirement and said to build the primitive against it rather than before it).
#
# This is deliberately NOT that verb rebuilt. The tombstone's objection to
# enumeration was that a filesystem listing "answers a question no ceremony asks
# and can disagree with state". Both halves still hold - so what ships is the
# DISAGREEMENT ITSELF: the set of directories under <repo>/.worktrees that no
# work item in state claims. That set is the finding, and it is the only form of
# the question `doctor` has to ask.
#
# A directory is CLAIMED when a work item's journaled `worktree_path` is exactly
# it, or when its basename is a work item's id. The second arm is not slack.
# `oss_worktree_add` names the directory for its work item, but nothing writes
# `worktree_path` into state until `work_item_exec` journals one - so matching on
# the path alone reports every freshly-spawned worktree as an orphan, i.e. it is
# loudest precisely when the project is behaving correctly.
#
# PURE SELECTOR: the finding is the OUTPUT, never the rc. rc 0 means the check
# RAN, not that the tree is clean; a caller branching on rc reports every project
# as orphan-free. That is the same polarity the doctor SURFACE uses for
# quarantines, fakes and patch records - counted, surfaced as `warn:`, never
# folded into an exit code. (Those were doctor.sh checks until PR #184 slimmed
# the verb to its gate; they are skill prose now, and the polarity travelled with
# them.) It deliberately does NOT copy `oss touch_check`'s rc-0-is-a-hit
# polarity, which close/SKILL.md §7 already lists as a trap for exactly this

  # So every malformed shape reported EVERY directory as an orphan, at rc 0,
  # with a deletion-flavoured message. It was patched three times for three
  # shapes - malformed JSON, a non-array `.work_items`, a non-object element -
  # and a fourth shape would have done it again.

  # With a single call, jq's exit status IS the error signal, once: rc 0 means
  # the claims were inspected and the output is the finding; nonzero means they
  # were not, and NOTHING is reported.

  # Validation lives in the same expression as the computation, deliberately.
  # Splitting them into separate bash pre-guards is what kept going wrong: each
  # guard covered the one shape that had just been reported, and the next shape
  # walked straight past all of them into the `||`. Here the shape checks
  # `error()` out through the same channel the computation uses, so an
  # unvalidated shape cannot reach the finding path at all - and a junk record
  # is REFUSED rather than silently skipped, because "some records are garbage"
  # is not evidence that a directory is unclaimed.

  # wrong-repository directory the repo-key design exists to expose, and in the
  # worst case leaves private work sitting under the public canonical root.

  # lacks `target_repo` - never, for anything written since #272/#310 Task 4,
  # because `oss_entity_add_work_item` now always fills the field (explicit or
  # resolved). Computing it UNCONDITIONALLY would make every orphan check
  # refuse outright under N>1 declared repos, even one scoped to a perfectly
  # valid EXPLICIT key with no legacy record in sight - the declared-membership
  # check above already proved `$key` is real; ambiguity in the DEFAULT must
  # not veto a call that never asked for the default. (Measured: this broke
  # `private_core`-scoped orphan detection under the two-repo PRIV/QRT fixtures
  # in test-worktree.sh when implemented as the brief's literal unconditional
