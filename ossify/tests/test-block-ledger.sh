  # occurs on SEVEN non-comment lines of test-close.sh, only one of which is the
  # extraction, so repointing that one left check 4 green with the coverage
  # gone. (Codex P2 on PR #144 - the same class as the comment bug below, one

  # ONE awk pass, deliberately NOT `grep -v '#' | grep -Fq`. Under this file's
  # `set -o pipefail`, the downstream `grep -q` exits on its first match and
  # SIGPIPEs the upstream grep, so the pipeline reports failure for a line that
  # genuinely matched. That form failed a TRUE coverage claim.
  # `index()` is a literal substring test, so anchors containing regex
  # metacharacters compare as themselves.
  # The extraction line must also name the LEDGER'S SOURCE FILE. Requiring only
  # anchor + extraction construct still lets a call be repointed at a different
  # markdown source with its anchor unchanged, preserving a false covered-by
  # claim. (Codex P2 round 2 on PR #144.) The tests pass the source as a shell
  # variable, so resolve `VAR="..."` assignments in the test file first, expand
  # the extraction call's first argument, and require the ledger's path to be a
  # suffix of it. This is why every extraction was normalised to a single
  # `_extract_block <source-var> <anchor> <out>` line.
  # The FULL ledger path, with the test's own root variables resolved - not a
  # suffix. Stripping the first component and suffix-matching accepted
