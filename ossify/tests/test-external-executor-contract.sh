# External-executor contract — mechanical facts only.
#
# The external-executor mode is prose: the judgment half (when to halt, how to
# read a result, what a correction may skip) is deliberately NOT asserted here
# and belongs to the LLM-judge rubric. What IS asserted is the mechanical
# surface a consumer parses or types:
#
#   - the exact flag grammar `/run-spine <spine-id> --external-executor`
#   - the request/result record KEY SETS, by set equality in both directions,
#     so a missing field and an extra field are equally red
#   - the DEFAULT nested dispatch surviving every edit (the no-flag control)
#   - zero subagent-invocation forms in the external branch
#   - the two-value return enum, unchanged by the correction continuation
#   - zero `orca` in ossify's shipped product surfaces
#   - the inline-Layer-4 route under external mode, with the pre-existing
#     delegated-path conditions pinned beside it as the loosening's control
#
# COUNTING is one awk index() pass per needle. `grep -c` counts matching LINES
# and cannot see two hits on one line; `… | grep -q` can fail on a TRUE match
# under pipefail when the producer takes SIGPIPE. A needle counted exactly once
# is also provably contiguous — a pin that wrapped across a markdown line break
# would match zero times, not once.
#
# EVERY zero-count assertion carries a positive control beside it, because a
# missing or renamed file makes "zero occurrences" true for the wrong reason.
