# wayfinder tracker resolution (#337) - branch 1's origin normalization,
# extracted from the shipped prose and executed for real.
#
# SCOPE. block-ledger.tsv classified all FOUR of tracker.md's bash blocks as
# D ("covered by no suite") because three of them are live `gh` API calls
# with no local fixture path - see the D row this file's own change shrinks
# from 4 to 3. The ladder block (the one extracted below) is different: `oss
# repo_root` and `git remote get-url origin` are local, git-only reads, so it
# is testable without a live GitHub credential or network call.
#
# #337 found the gap this file exists to close: the sed pipeline that derives
# $OWNER_REPO from a live git origin documented three remote spellings (git@,
# ssh://, plain https) and silently missed a fourth git also produces - https
# with userinfo, e.g. an authenticated CI remote
# (https://x-access-token:TOKEN@github.com/owner/repo). None of the three sed
# rules touched that shape, so $OWNER_REPO came out as the ENTIRE credentialed
# origin - a secret bound into a variable the reachability guard, branch 4's
# stop, and branch 0's own stop message all print to the terminal on failure.
#
# ROUND 2 (same issue, review found the round-1 fix still leaked). Two more
# defects in the userinfo handling itself:
#   - the userinfo character class excluded @ as well as /, so it stopped at
#     the FIRST @ rather than the last one before the host. A password
#     containing a raw, unescaped @ (user:p@ss@github.com/...) stripped only
#     "user:p@" and left "ss@github.com/..." still credential-bearing. The
#     percent-encoded-password case below was NOT sufficient to catch this -
#     %40 is three literal characters, never a competing @ - so this file
#     shipped once already without a test that could catch it.
#   - the ssh strip was anchored to a literal github.com host, so an ssh
#     origin carrying userinfo on any OTHER host leaked untouched.
#
# ROUND 3 (same issue, third time). Rounds 1-2 fixed ssh:// then ssh://+
# https://, one rule per scheme - and each round the scheme that was NOT
# enumerated rode a credential straight through. A plain http:// origin, or
# git://, hit neither the ssh nor the https rule and leaked exactly like the
# original #337 report. The fix is now scheme-agnostic (one rule matching
# any RFC-3986-shaped scheme before `://`, not an enumeration), which is a
# shorter pipeline than round 2's AND does not miss the next scheme. The
# "http:// with userinfo" and "git:// with userinfo" cases below are what
# rounds 1 and 2 shipped without.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER. Only branch 1 (an origin is present) is
# exercised, across all four documented spellings plus several extra
# userinfo shapes (bare-token, percent-encoded password, raw multi-@
# password, non-github ssh host, empty userinfo, http:// and git://
# schemes). Branch 0's actual conflict-stop (a mismatched .wayfinder.json)
# and branches 2/3 (no origin - dotfile read) are NOT exercised here; the
# block is one fenced unit under this ledger's convention (O rows cover a
# whole block, never a slice), so this row converts the whole ladder block
# to O while this comment - and the git history at #337 - is the honest
# record of which paths inside it a real assertion touches. The other three
# D-blocks (reachability probe, GraphQL frontier query, ticket-label check)
# are unchanged: still live `gh` calls, still uncovered here, still D.
#
# DEFERRED, logged for the final review, neither a credential issue: a
# port-bearing or IPv6 origin (github.com:443/... or [::1]/...) strips any
# credential correctly but leaves $OWNER_REPO malformed, since the literal
# `https://github\.com/` strip does not match a `github.com:443/` prefix -
# functional, since it fails closed at the reachability guard rather than
# resolving wrong. And a trailing slash after `.git` defeats the `\.git$`
# anchor. Neither is exercised below; neither leaks anything.
#
# The block is EXTRACTED from the shipped prose via oss_block_extract, never
# retyped, and run under real `set -euo pipefail` through a PATH-shimmed `oss`
# that execs the real dispatcher - so the subject under test is the artifact
# an agent will actually copy-run, not a paraphrase of it.
