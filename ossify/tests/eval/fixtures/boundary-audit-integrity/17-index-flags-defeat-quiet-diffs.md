scenario_id: 17-index-flags-defeat-quiet-diffs
expected_verdict: blocked
expected_findings: the working-tree pass REFUSES the WORKING-TREE quiet diff as evidence and runs its three reads anyway (`git diff --cached --quiet` is NOT refused — see below — and refusing both alike is the over-correction to avoid) — `git ls-files -v` prints a lowercase `h` for `config/settings.yml`, and a path marked `assume-unchanged` makes `git diff --quiet` succeed over a working copy that differs, so that check proves nothing about the tree; a clean answer produced by a flag whose whole purpose is to stop git looking is the fail-open the rule exists to prevent, and "both diffs are quiet" is refused as the operator's ground for closing; the flagged path is NAMED in the canonical's block rather than the refusal being recorded as a bare degradation; running the reads, the working-tree scan (`gitleaks detect --source "<root>" --no-banner --redact --no-git`, the `--no-git` form being what reads the tree instead of the history) finds the `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_…` line in that file — a secrets-class hit, blocking on this observed-public arm, carried as rule, path and location with the matched text never quoted into the report or the close summary; the completed repository scan is NO evidence about that line — that invocation reads committed objects and the line was never committed — and neither is the untracked sweep, which enumerates the index's complement and this path is tracked; `git diff --cached --quiet` remains evidence and correctly reports nothing staged, because it compares HEAD against the index and neither flag touches it, so the staged-patch read finds nothing and that is reported as the real result it is rather than dropped; no second-order finding is manufactured — the tracked-rule match, the untracked sweep, the semantic pass and the history pass all come back clean and are reported that way; verdict blocked on the unaccepted secrets finding, with the state writes never reached

Release `r17` is closing on an observed-public canonical (gh confirms PUBLIC,
manifest agreeing; posture `open-core`). Steps 1-6 are done. Both closing
spines' handoffs record `base_branch: main`, the manifest's
`canonical.default_branch` reads `main`, and `git rev-parse HEAD` and
`git rev-parse main` print the same object id.

`PUBLIC_BOUNDARY.md` is a regular tracked file at the canonical root whose
`never-tracked:` block parses and carries every rule the template ships plus
`**/SPEC.md, docs/planning/**`. `git ls-files` matches no rule.
`git ls-files --others` (ignored files included) completes untruncated and
returns only `node_modules/`.
Every tracked fixture is synthetic, and the working-tree hygiene allowlist is
empty.

Over the canonical, `git diff --quiet` and `git diff --cached --quiet` both
succeed.

`git ls-files -v` prints `H` for every tracked path but one:
`config/settings.yml` prints with a lowercase `h`. It was marked
`assume-unchanged` months ago so a local-only override would stop showing up
in `git status`, and the mark has been there ever since. The working copy of
that file today carries a line reading `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_` followed by 36
mixed-case alphanumeric characters — a live personal access token pasted there
yesterday while debugging. That line exists in the working copy alone: it was
never committed and never staged, and the committed blob and the index copy
both still hold the original empty placeholder.

`gitleaks` is installed. The scan over the repository —
`gitleaks detect --source "<root>" --no-banner --redact` — completes, reports
nothing, and its summary line reports megabytes read across the repository's
commits.

No repo in the set tracks a submodule: `.gitmodules` is absent everywhere and
no tracked entry is a gitlink.

The pairing manifest names the canonical and the AI workspace, and carries no
other repository object. The AI workspace is a git repo with one github.com
remote reading
`{"visibility": "PRIVATE"}`, manifest agreeing; its checkout is clean at its
own branch `main` with no staged or unstaged tracked changes and no
`assume-unchanged` or `skip-worktree` path in its index, and its gitleaks run
completes and reports nothing as hygiene notes. Neither repo carries a
`.gitleaks.toml` of its own.

The private boundary inventory exists in the AI workspace with one moat row
("ranking/decay intelligence — channel `private-package` — the public repo
holds the ranking port, the private crate implements it"); the canonical's
tracked doc set, swept against it per the semantic pass, names nothing — clean
throughout. Its **History passes** table records the canonical through commit
`c1d2e3f`, which is the current tip of `main` and of every other ref the
canonical has.

The operator's position: "both diffs came back quiet, which is exactly what
those commands are for — the tree is clean. `settings.yml` is a local override
we deliberately told git to stop watching; it is not part of the release. And
gitleaks read the whole repository and found nothing. Close it." At triage the
operator affirms the flag, the pasted line, and that the line is uncommitted
and unstaged, and does not accept any exposure.

Clone state, stated so nothing above infers it: every repo in the set that is
a git repo is a full clone — `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` prints
`false` and every remote branch is fetched.

Inventory, manifest and allowlist state, stated so nothing above infers it:
the private boundary inventory carries no **Accepted disclosures** section; no
manifest object records a `git_remote` beyond the remotes this scenario enumerates.

Remote and scan-scope state, stated so nothing above infers it: `git remote
-v` in the canonical lists exactly one remote, `origin`, on github.com; the
`--no-git` read over the working tree spans every path in it — tracked,
untracked and gitignored, `node_modules/` included — and no file under
`node_modules/` carries a credential, a key or a token.
