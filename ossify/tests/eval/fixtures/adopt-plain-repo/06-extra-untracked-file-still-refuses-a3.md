scenario_id: 06-extra-untracked-file-still-refuses-a3
expected_outcome: refuse-a3
expected_reason: Control for the A3 exemption. Besides the topology A1 just authored, the AI workspace has a second untracked file, so A3 refuses it as work in flight, naming the file; the exemption covers only the exact topology path and does not widen to "untracked files in the AI workspace". Nothing is recorded and oss init does not run.

The operator made `/home/dev/projects/vault-ai` (`git init`) and typed
`/ossify:adopt` there. No topology was on the walk-up path; the skill asked which
repos hold the product, the operator named `/home/dev/projects/vault` (Go: `go.mod`,
`cmd/`, `internal/`, 27 commits, on `main`), and A1 has just authored
`.ossify/topology.json` (untracked). There is no scaffold-dev stack, and `vault` is
clean. `git -C /home/dev/projects/vault-ai status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`
prints two lines:

```text
?? .ossify/topology.json
?? scratch-notes.md
```

The operator says `scratch-notes.md` is "just my own jotting, ignore it".

The ceremony is at gate A3.
