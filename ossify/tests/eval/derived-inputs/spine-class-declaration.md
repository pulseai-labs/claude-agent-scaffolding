# Derived input set — `spine-class-declaration`

**What this is.** The inputs `rubrics/spine-class-declaration.md` reads,
derived from that rubric in one pass. A fixture body on this surface must
declare every class below, because **every criterion is scored on every
fixture**. An input a criterion reads but the body never states is scored
against a guess.

**What this is not.** It is not a second copy of the rubric and states no
rule. Each row points at the criteria that read it; **the rubric is the
authority on what those criteria say**, and where the two disagree the rubric
wins. Kept out of `fixtures/<surface>/` because `lib/aggregate-scores.sh`
globs `*.md` inside each surface directory and treats every one it finds as a
fixture owing a result JSON.

**Re-derive it when the rubric changes.** A criterion edited to read something
new adds a row here; this list is downstream of the rubric and goes stale
silently. The deployment-evidence row (I4/I5) was added with criterion 6.

| # | Input class | Read by criteria |
|---|---|---|
| I1 | the proposed spine's scope — an architectural layer with no actor-to-outcome journey (a horizontal build) vs an actor-to-outcome journey | 1, 2 |
| I2 | the declared class — `bone` / `flesh` / `internal-enabler` / reject | 1 |
| I3 | whether the scope touches a registered bone's touch surface — a flesh claim touching a bone | 3 |
| I4 | whether a service extraction is proposed — a new separately-deployed service (its own process, image, pipeline, and on-call surface) vs work kept in-process | 6 |
| I5 | the measured-pressure evidence for a split — contemporaneous and checkable (a bottleneck profile, a load figure it cannot meet in-process, an outage where its failure took the rest down, an enacted compliance rule forbidding co-location, an ownership transfer that has happened) or its absence / an anticipated need only ("it will need to scale independently") | 6 |
| I6 | whether the plan is a genuine flesh spine on existing bones (no over-ceremony) vs inflated to bone | 4 |
| I7 | the governing rule the rationale cites — journey requirement / bone-touch / enabler consumer / deployment-evidence bar | 5 |
| I8 | for an internal-enabler, the named consuming user-facing spine scheduled in the current or next release (one-release-ahead cap) | 2 |

## The two ways a declaration still fails

**Declared as an outcome rather than a fact.** "The class is bone" is
criterion 1's conclusion wearing an input's clothes — state the scope, the
touch, and the evidence, not the class the criterion derives from them.

**Omitting the deployment-evidence input on a split.** A body that proposes a
service extraction without stating the measured pressure (or its absence)
hands criterion 6 a guess between admitting the split as bone and deferring it
to the feature map.
