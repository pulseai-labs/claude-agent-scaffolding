# --- Final review M1: when OSS_STATE_FILE overrides a MANIFEST-ROUTED project,
# say so. A stale export left by an unrelated session silently redirects every
# read and write, and nothing in the output named the source. Three properties
# are asserted because each one is separately load-bearing:
#   (a) the notice never touches stdout — `_oss_resolve_state`'s stdout IS the
#       state path, and every `oss get` consumer treats stdout as a value;
#   (b) it names the env var AND the manifest path being overridden;
#   (c) it stays silent when nothing is actually being overridden (the env var
#       agrees with the manifest), so it does not become noise to tune out.
#
# #171 SETTLED 2026-08-16: the rail stays blunt and self-describing. An equivalent
# spelling STILL fires the notice — by design, and the notice's own text now says

# TOPOLOGY TWIN (#272/#310 Task 11, spec decision O1): pairing.json is
# normalized on read into ONE internal shape, so the manifest-resolution
# mechanics this file pins against .workspace/pairing.json above must hold
# byte-for-byte against .ossify/topology.json too - if they diverged, the
# fallback would be a second dialect, not a genuine adapter.
#
# A FRESH temp tree ($TMPT, never $TMP above) and a repo named "core" -
# deliberately never "canonical" - so nothing below can pass by coincidence
# of a magic name. "ai_workspace" resolves throughout even though
# topology.json carries no `ai_workspace` KEY at all: it is derived
# structurally (the parent of `.ossify/`), not read off a field the way the
# pairing arm reads `.ai_workspace.root`.
#
# SCOPED to the assertions that actually read the manifest: discovery, the
# convention default, a routed well_known_paths token, the unresolved-token
# guard, the RELATIVE-path guard, the dispatcher smoke check, spec_path's
# convention/override/unresolved-token/relative-path refusal quartet, and
# the '&' literalness guarantee. Left untwinned, with the reason at each:
#   - _oss_resolve_state's OSS_STATE_FILE precedence and override-notice
#     wording (:59-154 above) - no manifest read at all in those assertions,
#     just a bare `/explicit/x.json` and a raw env var.
#   - the `_oss_manifest_wellknown_guard`/PLUGIN_DATA/`_oss_subst_literal`
#     blocks (:156-294 above) - pure functions over an already-resolved
#     string, no discovery, no shape, no manifest source involved.
#   - `oss_manifest_get '.ai_workspace.root'` and the removed-`manifest_get`-
#     verb coverage (:80-98 above) - `.ai_workspace.root` is pairing-specific
#     read vocabulary with no topology analog (topology has no such field to
#     read; `_oss_manifest_ai_root` reads `.workspace` off the SHAPE
#     instead, which is what this twin's own dispatcher `repo_root
#     ai_workspace` check just below already exercises for the topology
#     source.
