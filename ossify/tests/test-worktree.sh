# whose basename is not a work-item id but whose PATH is journaled
# (:346-353, which the legacy comment calls out as a code path disjoint from
# the id-claim arm), cross-repo non-attribution (:397-406), and the
# dispatcher-path invocation under real `set -euo pipefail` (:359-364, whose
# own comment says the unmatched-glob guard and the `jq -e || printf` pair
# behave differently under strict mode). Review round 1, finding 2: an
# earlier draft of this twin covered only 3 of the 6 and did not name the
# other 3 as excluded - not a defensible triage, so all 6 are here now.
#
# SCOPED DELIBERATELY everywhere else, not a line-for-line replay of the
# whole file: the git-hook-chatter, dirty-worktree-halt, unmerged-branch,
# spine-branch-lifecycle, permission-bit and path-quoting assertions above

# LEGACY RECORDS UNDER N>1. Every pre-#272 journal holds work items with no
# `target_repo` at all. `oss_worktree_orphans` computes a default key to
# attribute those, and under more than one declared repo `_oss_default_repo_key`
# refuses. The REFUSAL is correct and deliberate - #272/#310 Task 4's fail-safe
# rule, pinned by the PRIV fixture below: guessing a repo for an unattributable
# record is worse than stopping. What was wrong is that it borrowed
# `_oss_default_repo_key`'s "no repo key given" wording on a call that gave one,
# sending the caller to re-run with the argument they already passed.
