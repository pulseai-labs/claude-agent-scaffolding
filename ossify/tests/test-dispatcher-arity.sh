# The DISPATCHER SURFACE, not any one lib: every `oss <verb>` invoked with too
# few arguments must answer with the rc-2 usage error the taxonomy defines
# (lib/commands.sh's header note — "1 generic, 2 usage, 3 lock, ...") and never with bash's
# raw `unbound variable` diagnostic at rc 1.
#
# WHY THIS FILE RUNS THE REAL DISPATCHER AND BUILDS A REAL PROJECT:
#
# 1. `bin/oss` runs `set -euo pipefail`; every other suite sources the libs
#    directly and is therefore NON-strict. An unguarded `"$1"` is invisible to a
#    sourced-function test and fatal through the dispatcher. Only `bash "$OSS"`
#    sees it.
# 2. The fixture MUST have a pairing manifest and an initialized state. Run from
#    a directory with neither, 46 of the 61 verbs short-circuit on
#    `_oss_resolve_state`'s manifest error BEFORE ever touching `$1` — which
#    measures 13 leaking verbs instead of the real 44. That is not a
#    hypothetical: it is the mis-measurement this test was written to prevent.
#
# The loop is over the LIVE verb list from `oss help`, not a hand-maintained
# array, so a verb added later is covered the day it ships.

# --- retired verbs stay retired --------------------------------------------

# they carried (rules_validate's --file shell-source path; harvest_apply's
# write path; interop_check's 175-line read-out). A partial revert or a
# copy-paste revival would reintroduce a surface the prose now says does not
# exist — and the suite would stay green, because nothing else checks verb
# ABSENCE. Same guard test-worktree.sh pins on worktree_list and
# test-manifest.sh pins on manifest_get.
#
# BOTH assertions are load-bearing. rc 2 alone cannot prove absence: the exact
# deleted wrappers open with `_oss_need … || return 2`, so a verbatim revert
# answers rc 2 too — with a USAGE message. Only the dispatcher's own
# "unknown subcommand" diagnostic separates "gone" from "revived and asking
# for arguments". (Codex P2, PR #187 round 2.)
