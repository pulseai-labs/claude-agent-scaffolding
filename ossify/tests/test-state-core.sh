# --- Final review finding 4: the §9.2 schema guard sat on NO write path. Its
# only caller was doctor — advisory and read-only — so this v1 build happily
# journaled v1-semantics ops into a state file claiming a future schema, while
# the guard's own header promised it would "refuse to operate". A version guard
# only protects the v1->v2 transition if it ships IN v1; an already-installed
# build can never be retrofitted. Run under a real `set -euo pipefail`, the way
# bin/oss does.
#
# The guard is placed BEFORE `mkdir "$lock"` deliberately: a `return 6` after
# the lock is taken would jump past the wrapper's unconditional `rmdir` and
# wedge the state file permanently — so the no-lock-left-behind assertion below
# is guarding the fix's fix, not a nicety.
