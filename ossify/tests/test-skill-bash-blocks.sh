# SKILL.md bash-block harness - prose gets CI.
#
# ossify's skills ARE the product: a ceremony is prose, and a bash block inside
# it is a shipped contract. Nothing else in this suite reads that prose, so a
# skill can document a verb no dispatcher implements, a `Skill()` parameter the
# runtime does not accept, or a block that does not parse, and every gate stays
# green. This file is that gate.
#
# SCOPE - check, do not execute. Seven mechanical facts: parse-validity, verb
# resolution, Skill() arity, the command-body arg bridge, reference
# reachability, the SKILL.md line budget, and shadowed Skill(ossify:) tokens.
# (Route-pointer integrity was the eighth; it was removed at #284 round 2 -
# see the tombstone at check 8's old site.) Executing skill prose would need
# a fixture per ceremony, would have side effects, and would test the fixture
# instead of the contract.
#
# WHAT IT HONESTLY DOES NOT CATCH. Check 2 resolves `oss <subcommand>` tokens -
# ossify's own dispatcher verbs. A phantom *lib function* (the `sd_rules_apply`
# class: five citations, zero definitions) is not an `oss` subcommand and does
# not pass through here; what check 2 catches is the analogous class inside
# ossify's verb surface. And a cross-skill *semantic* contract - the `[internal]`
# marker one skill sets and another reads - is not a parse or symbol fact at
# all, so no check below can see it. Nor does check 2 read bare prose: it scans
# code contexts only (fenced blocks and inline-code spans), so `oss frobnicate`
# written in a sentence without backticks is not a contract citation and is not
# resolved. Those are the boundaries; a test credited with coverage it does not
# have is how the next phantom entry point ships.
#
# THE SELF-TEST IS THE POINT. This artifact is itself a test, so an extractor
# that silently stops extracting goes green forever and takes all seven checks
# with it - and nothing downstream can notice. Every check therefore runs twice:
# once against the shipped tree (expect zero findings) and once against a
# purpose-built fixture carrying exactly one planted defect per check (expect
# exactly that one, named). A run is only meaningful because the second half
# proves the first half was still looking.

#  (b) WILDCARD MENTIONS. A token containing `*` or ending in `_` is a
#      deliberate family reference (`oss ledger_add_*`), not a verb. That is
#      the 7th. Excluded tokens are printed so the exclusion set stays visible

# Check 5 - reference reachability, two halves.
#
# ORPHANS: every references/*.md under a skill must be named by that skill's own
# SKILL.md. A pointer from a sibling reference does not make a file reachable -
# the agent reads SKILL.md, not the directory listing. This supersedes the
# per-skill loop that lived in test-close.sh, which enforced the same rule for
# one skill only.
#
# DANGLING: the resolution base, stated explicitly. A pointer written
# `references/foo.md` resolves against the SKILL DIRECTORY - not the repo root,
# and not the citing file's own directory (which for a reference file would
# give references/references/). Three pointer forms exist in the tree:
#   references/X.md                -> <skill-dir>/references/X.md
#   <skill>/references/X.md        -> <ossify-root>/skills/<skill>/references/X.md
#   skills/<skill>/references/X.md -> <ossify-root>/skills/...
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}-rooted pointers are runtime-expanded and are skipped by
# the extraction regex, which refuses a `}` or `/` immediately before the match.
#
# CROSS-SKILL, reported and not failed: some shipped pointers are written bare
# but name a sibling skill's file, with the owning skill supplied by the
# possessive prose immediately before it ("Same rules as `start`'s
# `references/bones-registry.md`"). Qualifying those would read "`start`'s
# `start/references/...`" - worse prose for no gain, since the file exists. They
# are reported as exclusions, on the same discipline as check 2, and only a
# pointer that resolves NOWHERE fails. THE ACCEPTED BLIND SPOT: an intra-skill
# typo that happens to collide with a sibling skill's filename lands in the
# reported set instead of failing.

# (poc-first-lifecycle-design.md :115-119, :467) targets every-call listing
# cost at 0.3-0.4% of the window: 0.4% of 200k tokens = 800 tokens; at the
# 4.0 chars/token ratio the C1 numbers embed (3121 bytes = 0.39% = 780
# tokens - internally consistent), the band edge is 800 x 4.0 = 3200 bytes.
# The previous constant 3121 was the C1 trim's LANDING POINT (4180 -> 3121,
# 0.52% -> 0.39%), 79 bytes inside the edge: a historical accident, not the
# band. Nothing enforced any of it before C1, and the trim had drifted back
# to 3135 by v0.2 planning - a budget nobody measures is not a budget.
#
# MEASUREMENT is description-only, in bytes under the LC_ALL=C exported at
# the top of this file - the same method the ceiling is derived in. The
# listing's "- ossify:<name>: " prefixes add real cost (230 bytes at the
# twelve-command set measured in #263, name-length-dependent) but are harness
# rendering this test does not own; recorded here, not measured.
#
# HONESTY LINE: the thirteen-command surface measures 2278/3200 = 0.28% of
# the window - 1.4x headroom, and just under §9.1's 0.3-0.4% band, because
# three of the thirteen are standalone utilities §9.1 intended to surface
# name-only (issue #282 records that divergence and why trimming is the
# wrong fix: budget nobody is short of, traded against routing triggers).
# This check is a regression guard against growth, not a tight budget; it
# cannot fire until the surface grows another 40%. Know that is what it is.
#
# DIVERGENCES recorded here, fixed elsewhere:
#   D-2: §9.1 says "<=6 fully-described entry skills" and lists six;
#        run-spine is a de-facto seventh full entry (lifecycle baton target),
#        #267's adopt is an eighth, and Batch S's challenge is a ninth,
#        unless §9.1 is amended deliberately -
#        the amendment is #267's to make. This check enforces bytes, not
#        count, on purpose.
#   D-3: §9.1's doctor row still allocates the phase-2 migration entry point
#        the adopt-forward spec rejected on doctor's report-only contract;
#        falls to the same §9.1 amendment.
#
# The floor assertion is not decoration: a glob that silently matches nothing
# sums to 0, which sails under any ceiling. That is the same vacuity mode

# Check 9 - no shadowed Skill(ossify:<name>) tokens anywhere the harness owns.
#
# The bare form that CAUSED #262: Skill(ossify:close) is shadowed by
# commands/close.md, so the call loads the ~20-line wrapper, not the skill
# body, and dead-ends. Check 3 catches only comma-bearing invocations
# (Skill\(x, target=y\)); a prose edit restoring a bare token - from git
# history, a regenerated wrapper, a reference doc - passes every gate
# (#263's review, finding 2). The sanctioned route is the wrapper's
# path-routing Read line or a cross-PLUGIN call into another plugin's
# skill. The scan owns the plugin-root references/
# tree too, because three wrappers load it directly (Codex r1 on #283).
#
# SHADOW-CONDITIONED (Codex r2 on #284): the dead-end exists only where
# commands/<name>.md actually shadows a same-named skill. A future skill
# with no same-named command is NOT shadowed and invoking it by token is
# legal - the check extracts the name and fires only on the collision.
