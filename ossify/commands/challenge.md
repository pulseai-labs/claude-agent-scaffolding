description: Grill a plan or design, or adversarially audit a written spec/plan — ossify's internal challenge skill, with a configurable external adversary at close depth. Use for "grill me", "stress-test this", "audit this spec", or to run the critic outside a ceremony.
argument-hint: "[artifact-path]"
allowed-tools: Bash(bash:*), Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep

Parse args from `$ARGUMENTS` via the env-var bridge (no positional `$1`/`$2`/`$N`),
then load the challenge skill body, whose router you load below.

```bash
ARGS_FROM_CLAUDE="$ARGUMENTS" bash -c '
  set -u
  ARGS="${ARGS_FROM_CLAUDE:-}"
  echo "challenge: ARGS=${ARGS:-<none>}"
'
```

Now load the skill body and follow it:

**Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/challenge/SKILL.md` end to end and follow
it** — with the parsed artifact path if one was given (audit mode), or against
the plan in conversation if none was (interview mode). The skill body routes;
`references/audit.md`, `references/interview.md`, and
`references/adversaries.md` carry the procedures.

This command registers on Claude Code only — no ossify command registers on
OpenCode at all (#131 tracks that gap) — while the skill body itself reaches
OpenCode by path as the native `challenge` skill.
