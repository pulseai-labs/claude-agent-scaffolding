# herdr-crew — the context-ceiling hook (#456), behaviour at its interface.
#
# Feeds hook-input JSON on stdin to hooks-handlers/context-ceiling.sh the way
# Claude Code does, against a transcript written per case, and checks stdout
# and the exit code. Silent cases sit beside firing controls built by the same
# fixture writers, so a handler that prints nothing cannot pass. A few cases run
# the handler against a PATH stripped of one binary, or with a jq stub that
# fails, because three of its notices are about a read it could not make at all.
#
# Usage:    bash herdr-crew/tests/test-context-ceiling-hook.sh
# Exit:     0 if every case holds; 1 otherwise.
# Deps:     bash 3.2+, jq.
# Override: CONTEXT_CEILING_HOOK=<path> runs the cases against another copy of
#           the handler (the mutation checks use it).
