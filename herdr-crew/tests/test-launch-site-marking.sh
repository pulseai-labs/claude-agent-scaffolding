# herdr-crew — every launch-verb site in the shipped prose carries a seat-mods
# marking clause (#663).
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS. The seat-mods marking (a guarded role + `SEAT_MODS_ALLOW`, or
# `coordinator`, or `orchestrator`) is stated in prose at every launch site, by
# reference to `herdr-mechanics.md` step 2. Pinned suites catch a site that LOSES its
# clause; nothing caught a NEW launch site added without one. This suite selects the
# launch sites by the rule below and fails when a selected site's own region carries
# no marking clause — the #651 recurrence shape.
#
# THE SITE RULE (A2). A *region* is a markdown list item (its marker line through its
# deeper-indented continuation lines) when the text sits in one, else a
# blank-line-delimited paragraph. YAML frontmatter (a region starting at line 1 with
# `---`) and heading lines are skipped. `**` spans are stripped and whitespace is
# squeezed before matching, so a bold verb or article still selects. A region is a
# launch site when its stripped text matches any of:
#
#   1. `herdr tab create`
#   2. `herdr worktree create` with `--path` in the same region (the flag that names
#      the seat's new tree; a bare mention that defers its flags elsewhere is not one)
#   3. `herdr workspace create` with no `run:` in the region (the run's own workspace
#      is not a seat launch)
#   4. `launch(ed|es|ing)? {a|an|the|its|each|every|from|as|it|to|at} <0-40 chars,
#      sentence- and paren-bounded> seat(s)` — "launched from the project file's
#      close-session seat", "Launch it as the seat launch", "launches each writer as a
#      guarded seat", the `SEATS row(s)` spellings included
#   5. `launch(ed|es|ing)? from {those|them|these}`
#   6. `{launch(es|ed)?|dispatch(es|ed)?|create[sd]?|respawn(s|ed)?} [det] {fresh|new}
#      <0-20 chars, sentence- and paren-bounded> {seat(s)|pair|implementer|verifier|
#      reviewer|writer|spine session|work-PR session|close session|doctor session}`
#   7. `{fresh|new} <0-20> {seat(s)|pair} <0-20> {you create|you dispatch|you launch|
#      you spawn|to resume}`
#   8. `respawn`
#
# A site carries a marking clause when its own region contains any of:
# `SEAT_MODS_ROLE=`, `guarded`, `coordinator`, `orchestrator`, `step 2`, `Seat marking`.
#
# COVERED: the three placement commands; "launch(ed) from the … seat"; "launch
# a/the/its … [fresh|new] seat|pair|…" including bold verbs and articles and the
# create/dispatch/respawn verb forms, the close-session and doctor-session nouns
# included; "launched from the … SEATS row(s)"; "every respawn … is launched from the
# same row"; "a fresh seat you create"; "a fresh seat to resume"; bare `respawn`.
#
# NOT COVERED — a new site in one of these shapes still passes, and that residual is
# accepted (naming it is the point): the bare noun "the seat launch" (it collides with
# SKILL.md §1's router sentence, which is a pointer and needs no clause); "launched at
# its point or on demand" (operator roles); a marking directive with no launch verb
# ("Mark it `coordinator` before its command", "is a guarded `implementer`"); router and
# depth descriptions ("drives a fresh tab and pane per item seat", "launches item
# sessions of its own", "launched by seat name", "start one spine session"); "create …
# from its … row" (the reviewer-row instruction, clause-carrying where it stands); a
# dispatch whose command string intervenes before the fresh noun ("dispatch
# `/ossify:close <spine-id>` to a fresh close session", SKILL.md:156 — clause-carrying
# where it stands); a launch sentence directly under a heading with no blank line (it
# merges into the heading's region and is dropped); frontmatter whose `---` has no blank
# line after it (the skip takes the body's first region with it); a launch written only
# inside a `kind: dsh-spine-driver` session (not a pane — it is never marked); headings
# and frontmatter.
#
# CLAUSE-SIDE LOOSENING, stated: any bare mention of the clause tokens in the region
# satisfies the check (e.g. a site beside the words "the coordinator seats" passes
# without stating the marking), and `step 2` is also lifecycle's own step 2 — a site
# next to such a mention passes. That direction is deliberate: it keeps today's correct
# sites green, and test-ossify-spine-contract.sh's one-pin-per-site block holds every
# clause text the shipped prose states.
#
# FENCE BLINDNESS, stated: the scanner does not model ``` fences — a fenced template's
# prose is scanned like any paragraph. Today's green there is for the right reason (the
# spine brief's item steps carry their real guard clauses), but a template-only reword
# is judged on its own text, not on its role as a template.
#
# CONTROLS, beside the assertions they protect:
#   - B2 (red/green): a fixture copy of the shipped tree with ONE added unmarked
#     launch site must fail, naming file, line and the site text; the same site with a
#     clause must pass. The fixture lives under mktemp, never in a shipped file.
#   - bold spans: fixture paragraphs with a bold article and with a bold verb must each
#     be selected — the "bold" half of the COVERED claim above, measured.
#   - B4 (floor): the number of sites selected is printed and pinned at today's count;
#     a grammar change that silently selects fewer sites fails. Its adjacent control is
#     a fixture the same predicate must refuse: a tree below the floor is not accepted.
#     The floor is a SUMMED total, so a net-zero grammar swap (one pattern dropped, one
#     added) keeps it — the per-pattern coverage rests on the controls here.
#   - per-file death: a scanned path whose own scan dies must print SCAN-ERROR and fail
#     the run, not vanish behind the other files' counts.
#
# Usage: bash herdr-crew/tests/test-launch-site-marking.sh
# Env:   HERDR_CREW_PROSE_ROOT=<dir>  scan that tree instead of the plugin's — the
#        red/green runs above use it; the suite's own controls always build their own
#        fixtures.
# Deps:  bash 3.2+, awk with ERE interval expressions (`{m,n}` — gawk, or mawk 1.3.4+;
#        an older mawk fails the scan), mktemp.
