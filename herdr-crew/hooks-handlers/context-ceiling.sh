# context-ceiling.sh — herdr-crew's context-ceiling notice (#456).
#
# Tells a session its own context figure once that figure reaches the ceiling, at the
# two moments new work starts: a prompt or a herdr wake (UserPromptSubmit) and a herdr
# new-work command (PreToolUse on Bash). It never allows, denies or asks, and it always
# exits 0: a hook failure must not stop a seat. Every seat in a herdr pane is told, since
# a session does not declare what it is; only a coordinator seat rotates on it, and what
# a unit is — for that, and for a leaf's finish-and-report — is prose: lifecycle.md,
# "Rotation past the context ceiling".
#
# The figure is input + cache_creation + cache_read tokens of the latest
# non-sidechain assistant record in the transcript Claude Code names in the
# hook input. One message's usage repeats on several transcript lines, so the
# latest record is read, never a sum. The transcript format is undocumented: a
# figure that cannot be read is reported as unavailable, never guessed, and a
# usage object that does not carry all three counters as numbers does not carry
# the figure.

# payload. The pass is gated exactly as the three spawns were: a jq that fails
# on the input leaves all three fields empty, and each field's emptiness is then

# spawns printed — @tsv refuses a container outright ("object (...) is not valid
# in a csv row"), and one such field would take the whole pass, event included,
